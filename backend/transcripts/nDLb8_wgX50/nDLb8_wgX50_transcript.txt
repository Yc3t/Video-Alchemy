00:00:00: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to the Huberman Lab podcast
00:00:02: where we discuss science
and science-based tools
00:00:04: for everyday life.
00:00:05: [MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:09: I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
00:00:11: of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
00:00:13: at Stanford School of Medicine.
00:00:15: My guest today is David Goggins.
00:00:17: David Goggins is a
retired Navy SEAL who
00:00:20: served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
00:00:22: He's also a highly accomplished
ultramarathon runner.
00:00:25: For those of you
that don't know,
00:00:27: ultramarathons are
distances longer
00:00:29: than 26 miles and, in
David's case, often longer
00:00:32: than 200 miles.
00:00:34: For his achievements
in athletics,
00:00:35: he has been inducted into
the International Sports
00:00:38: Hall of Fame.
00:00:39: He also held a Guinness World
Record for the most pull-ups
00:00:42: completed in 24 hours.
00:00:44: I should mention that not only
was David a decorated Navy
00:00:46: SEAL, but he also graduated
from Army Ranger School.
00:00:50: David is also a highly
successful writer,
00:00:53: having authored two books, the
first entitled "Can't Hurt Me"
00:00:56: and the second entitled "Never
Finished," both of which
00:00:58: are best sellers.
00:01:00: David's books cover
many topics, including
00:01:02: his autobiographical
description of what can only
00:01:05: be described as an
incredibly challenging child
00:01:09: and young adulthood.
00:01:10: His home was abusive.
00:01:12: His school environment
was abusive.
00:01:13: He essentially had no positive
resources directed his way and.
00:01:17: In his 20s, he found himself
to be obese, that is,
00:01:21: more than 300
pounds working a job
00:01:23: he despised for minimal pay.
00:01:25: And it was at that point that
David began an inner dialogue
00:01:30: that forced him to explore
the demons born out
00:01:32: of his childhood but also the
position that he found himself
00:01:35: in as a young man and
then began the journey
00:01:39: to navigate that dialogue and
transform himself into the Navy
00:01:42: SEAL, the ultramarathon
runner, the bestselling author,
00:01:45: and the extraordinarily
positive and influential man
00:01:48: that he is today.
00:01:49: As some of you may
know, David has
00:01:51: done various public lectures.
00:01:53: He's a familiar face
online because there are so
00:01:56: many clips of him on YouTube.
00:01:58: And he has done podcasts before.
00:02:00: However, I'm certain that
you'll find today's discussion
00:02:03: to be very different
than previous podcasts
00:02:06: that David has been featured on.
00:02:08: The reason is
that-- of course, we
00:02:10: get into his accomplishments.
00:02:11: We talk about the
mindset that allowed
00:02:13: him to achieve those things.
00:02:15: But, today, David really
lets us under the hood.
00:02:17: He lets us into the
form of inner dialogue
00:02:21: that he has to
embrace, indeed that he
00:02:23: has to grapple with on a daily
basis, sometimes multiple times
00:02:26: throughout the day
and night in order
00:02:29: to impose the sort
of self-discipline
00:02:31: that he is so well known for.
00:02:33: We also get into some of
the scientific mechanisms
00:02:35: underlying willpower.
00:02:36: And we talk about
David's current endeavors
00:02:39: that include, for instance,
his own exploration of science
00:02:43: and medicine for which he
has become an intense scholar
00:02:46: and practitioner.
00:02:47: I should mention that multiple
times throughout today's
00:02:50: discussion you will
hear curse words.
00:02:53: Now David and I both
acknowledge that cursing
00:02:55: isn't for everybody
and that cursing
00:02:58: itself is different than
cursing at somebody.
00:03:01: Nonetheless, we do realize
that many people, parents
00:03:05: perhaps especially, might
not want to hear cursing.
00:03:09: If you don't want
to hear cursing,
00:03:11: well, then this podcast episode
is probably not for you.
00:03:14: However, if you are
comfortable with cursing
00:03:16: or if you can tolerate
it, I assure you
00:03:19: today's discussion
is highly worthwhile.
00:03:22: Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
00:03:24: that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
00:03:26: roles at Stanford.
00:03:28: It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
00:03:30: to bring zero cost to
consumer information
00:03:32: about science and
science-related tools
00:03:34: to the general public.
00:03:35: In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
00:03:37: to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
00:03:40: Our first sponsor
is Maui Nui Venison.
00:03:42: Maui Nui Venison is the most
nutrient dense and delicious
00:03:45: red meat available.
00:03:47: I've spoken before
on this podcast
00:03:49: and there's general consensus
that most people should strive
00:03:52: to consume approximately
1 gram of protein
00:03:54: per pound of body weight.
00:03:56: Now when one strives
to do that, it's
00:03:58: important to maximize the
quality of that protein intake
00:04:01: to the calorie ratio
because you don't
00:04:03: want to consume an
excess of calories
00:04:05: when trying to get
that 1 gram of protein
00:04:07: per pound of body weight.
00:04:09: Maui Nui Venison has an
extremely high quality protein
00:04:12: to calorie ratio.
00:04:13: So it makes getting that 1
gram of protein per pound
00:04:15: of body weight extremely easy.
00:04:17: It's also delicious.
00:04:18: Personally, I like
the ground venison.
00:04:19: I also like the venison steaks.
00:04:21: And then for convenience
when I'm on the road,
00:04:23: I like the jerky.
00:04:25: The jerky has a very high
protein to calorie ratio.
00:04:28: So it has as much as 10 grams
of protein per jerky stick,
00:04:31: and it has something
like only 55 calories,
00:04:33: so, again, making
it very easy to get
00:04:35: enough protein without
consuming excess calories.
00:04:37: If you would like to

00:04:40: you can go to

00:04:50: Today's episode is also
brought to us by AeroPress.
00:04:53: AeroPress is similar to a
French press for making coffee,
00:04:56: but it is, in fact, a much
better way to make coffee.
00:04:59: I first learned about AeroPress
well over 10 years ago.
00:05:02: And I've been using
one ever since.
00:05:04: AeroPress was developed
by Alan Adler, who
00:05:07: was an engineer at Stanford.
00:05:08: And I knew of Alan
because he had also
00:05:11: built the so-called Aerobie
Frisbee, which I believe
00:05:14: at one time, perhaps
still now, held
00:05:15: the Guinness Book
of World Records
00:05:17: for furthest thrown object.
00:05:19: And I used to see Alan,
believe it or not,
00:05:21: at parks around Palo Alto
testing out different Aerobie
00:05:25: Frisbees.
00:05:25: So he was sort of
famous in our community
00:05:28: for developing these
different feats of engineering
00:05:31: that turned into
commercial products.
00:05:33: Now I love coffee.
00:05:34: I'm somebody that drinks coffee
nearly every day, usually
00:05:37: about 90 to 120
minutes after I wake up
00:05:39: in the morning,
although not always.
00:05:40: Sometimes if I'm
going to exercise,
00:05:42: I'll drink coffee first
thing in the morning.
00:05:44: But I love, love, love coffee.
00:05:47: And what I've personally found
is that by using the AeroPress,
00:05:50: I can make the best possible
tasting cup of coffee.
00:05:53: I don't know what exactly
it is in the AeroPress that
00:05:56: allows the same
beans to be prepared
00:05:58: into a cup of coffee that tastes
that much better as compared
00:06:02: to any other form of
brewing that coffee, even
00:06:04: the traditional French press.
00:06:06: The AeroPress is
extremely easy to use.
00:06:08: And it's extremely compact.
00:06:10: In fact, I take it with
me whenever I travel.
00:06:12: And I use it on the road,
in hotels, even on planes.
00:06:15: I'll just ask for
some hot water,
00:06:16: and I'll brew my coffee or
tea right there on the plane.
00:06:18: If you'd like to try
AeroPress, you can go
00:06:21: to aeropress.com/huberman.
00:06:23: That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcom
slash Huberman to get 20% off
00:06:29: any aeropress coffeemaker.
00:06:31: AeroPress ships anywhere

00:06:40: Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
00:06:43: Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
00:06:45: and sleep tracking capacity.
00:06:47: I've spoken many times
before on this podcast
00:06:49: about the fact that
sleep is the foundation
00:06:51: of mental health, physical
health, and performance.
00:06:54: Now a key component of
getting a great night's sleep
00:06:57: is that in order to fall
and stay deeply asleep,
00:06:59: your body temperature
actually has
00:07:01: to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.
00:07:03: And in order to wake up feeling
refreshed and energized,
00:07:06: your body temperature
actually has
00:07:07: to increase by about
1 to 3 degrees.
00:07:09: One of the best ways to make
sure that those temperature
00:07:12: changes occur at the appropriate
times, at the beginning
00:07:14: and throughout and at the end
of your night when you wake up,
00:07:17: is to control the temperature
of your sleeping environment.
00:07:20: And that's what Eight
Sleep allows you to do.
00:07:22: It allows you to program the
temperature of your mattress
00:07:24: and sleeping environment
such that you fall
00:07:26: and stay deeply asleep
easily and wake up
00:07:29: each morning feeling incredibly
refreshed and energized.
00:07:32: I've been sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress
00:07:34: cover for almost
three years now.
00:07:35: And it has dramatically improved
the quality of my sleep.
00:07:38: If you'd like to
try Eight Sleep,
00:07:40: you can go to
eightsleep.com/huberman to get
00:07:43: $150 off their Pod
3 mattress cover.
00:07:46: Eight Sleep currently
ships in the USA,
00:07:48: Canada, UK, select countries
in the EU, and Australia.
00:07:51: Again, that's
eightsleep.com/huberman.
00:07:54: And now for my discussion
with David Goggins.
00:07:57: David Goggins, welcome.
00:07:59: DAVID GOGGINS: My man.
00:08:00: Good to see you again, man.
00:08:01: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great to see you.
00:08:03: It was late 2016,
early 2017, I believe,
00:08:05: when you were in
my lab at Stanford.
00:08:06: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir.
00:08:07: ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a
little work later that day
00:08:10: down in San Jose.
00:08:11: And, gosh, see you everywhere,
but it's not enough.
00:08:15: So great to have you here.
00:08:16: DAVID GOGGINS: Thanks for
having me on, brother.
00:08:17: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
00:08:19: You embody discipline
and doing hard things.
00:08:23: I think we should just
start right off with--
00:08:24: DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah.
00:08:25: Let's just go there.
00:08:26: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--the bold truth.
00:08:27: But right before
we went hot mics,
00:08:31: we were talking about learning.
00:08:33: Right now, you're spending some
time learning and doing things
00:08:37: that I think most people
probably don't typically
00:08:39: associate David Goggins with.
00:08:40: DAVID GOGGINS: Right.
00:08:41: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don't
you tell us about that?
00:08:42: DAVID GOGGINS: Well,
most people just
00:08:44: look at me as the guy that
runs and yells as he's running.
00:08:48: While I do that to
motivate people,
00:08:51: but people don't understand
that my day is broken up
00:08:54: into segments.
00:08:56: I work out.
00:08:57: I eat.
00:08:58: I sleep, but I spend
most of my time studying.
00:09:01: So like I'm in
the medical world.
00:09:02: I'm a paramedic in Canada.
00:09:05: But I spend a lot
of my time trying
00:09:08: to nuke every single thing
about it because I'm not
00:09:11: trying to just be a
paramedic, learn about veins,
00:09:15: and arteries, and how the heart
pumps, and stuff like that.
00:09:17: I'm trying to learn
to the point where
00:09:19: I can save someone's life.
00:09:21: And even though paramedics are
doing that all over the world,
00:09:24: I'm trying to be that
paramedic that can really
00:09:26: dissect exactly what's going on
and figure out what medication
00:09:29: goes where, just trying to
learn the algorithm of what's
00:09:34: going on, man.
00:09:35: So I spent a lot
of time with it.
00:09:36: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
love the word algorithm
00:09:38: because when I teach
biology or try and learn
00:09:40: anything that's related
to biology and especially
00:09:43: the human body, I need
to know the nouns.
00:09:46: But it's the verbs that matter.
00:09:47: And that's really what
you're talking about.
00:09:49: Just saying that sits there,
that brain part there,
00:09:53: doesn't tell you how
it all works together.
00:09:55: So what does your process
for studying look like?
00:09:58: If we dropped a
camera in the room,
00:10:02: brought a microphone into
your inner dialogue--
00:10:06: gosh, wouldn't we all love that.
00:10:08: But if we dropped a microphone
into your inner dialogue,
00:10:10: are you waking up looking
at the books and going,
00:10:12: yeah, fresh day, let's learn or
is some of the same resistance
00:10:16: that you've talked about
coming up around physical work,
00:10:20: is that coming up
from time to time?
00:10:22: DAVID GOGGINS: You know
what, I was nervous at first.
00:10:25: I'm going to keep it real.
00:10:26: I'm going to keep it real.
00:10:28: So I'm not a real smart guy.
00:10:31: And what I mean by that is
I was born with ADD, ADHD.
00:10:35: Like my brain cannot
retain information.
00:10:38: I'm not some genetic freak
when it comes to running,
00:10:41: when it comes to
lifting weights.
00:10:42: I am absolutely the
bottom of the barrel.
00:10:44: And people will
never believe me.
00:10:47: And they can just whatever.
00:10:49: Believe what you
want to believe.
00:10:51: So when you ask me this question
about what does studying look
00:10:55: like for me, I have to go over
the same page over, and over,
00:11:01: and over, and over again, while
Jennifer can look at that page
00:11:04: while she's quizzing me,
she'll learn it right then
00:11:08: as she's-- she didn't
know anything about it.
00:11:10: She will quiz herself
or quiz me and learn it
00:11:14: as she's quizzing me.
00:11:15: It's the most frustrating
thing in the world
00:11:17: how my brain works.
00:11:19: So what I do is I literally
sit there with a pen and paper.
00:11:23: And I have my books.
00:11:24: And I go through and
have to write everything
00:11:27: down every single day.
00:11:31: I will study the
same page until it's
00:11:34: photographic memory from
writing the same thing down.
00:11:38: And then from there, I'll go
back through and relearn it
00:11:40: again.
00:11:41: So I'll learn the bulk of it.
00:11:44: But then I'll go through
and learn the small things
00:11:49: within that.
00:11:50: So if it's a medication, I'll
learn what the medication does.
00:11:54: First, I'll learn
how to even say
00:11:56: the medication because
these medications aren't
00:12:00: like albuterol.
00:12:01: No, it's very big words.
00:12:03: So I'll go through, learn
how to say the name.
00:12:05: Then I'll go through
learn what the dose is.
00:12:08: Then I'll go through-- and
this is like every single day.
00:12:11: So it's not like, oh, I got it.
00:12:13: Let's just go through--
no, nothing is I got it.
00:12:15: Every single thing--
so I can't wait
00:12:19: to get in this conversation
because everything
00:12:21: I do in life, it sucks.
00:12:24: Everything I do
in life, it sucks.
00:12:26: That's why when I was 300
pounds and 24 years old,
00:12:30: it wasn't like I had some
big epiphany of let's just
00:12:34: go be a Navy SEAL, and
let's lose some weight.
00:12:36: No, I knew my entire
life was going
00:12:40: to be a struggle, which
is why I just ignored it.
00:12:43: And I said, I'm not even trying
to jump off any of this shit
00:12:48: and learn how to read, how
to write, how to memorize,
00:12:51: how to become
something I am not.
00:12:54: But through that process,
something happened to me.
00:12:57: And I realized-- this is
why I feel sorry for no one.
00:13:01: In this podcast, they're
going to really not like me
00:13:05: because people
are going to think
00:13:07: that I am maybe lying or
maybe fibbing or exaggerating.
00:13:14: No, I am literally--
00:13:16: I was the lowest form on Earth,
no talent, no ability to learn.
00:13:22: And I literally know what
it is to be rock bottom
00:13:25: and to build that up.
00:13:26: So that question about
learning is the pain in my ass.
00:13:29: And I don't have to do it.
00:13:31: Just think about it.
00:13:32: I'm 49 years old, and
I'm a multi-millionaire.
00:13:35: I don't have to do anything.
00:13:37: So all I thought about
when I was growing up
00:13:39: is, man, I can't wait to
one day get to the point
00:13:44: where I no longer
have to do this stuff.
00:13:47: But what happened
as I got older,
00:13:49: it became a way of living.
00:13:51: So how I do every day
is how I do every day.
00:13:54: It's a discipline.
00:13:55: It's a regimen.
00:13:57: It was a choice I made.
00:13:59: And the choice I made was what
are you willing to sacrifice,
00:14:04: and what are you willing to
give up to find every bit of who
00:14:08: you are as a human being?
00:14:09: And I was willing to give
up everything to do that.
00:14:11: So studying is no joke.
00:14:13: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love
that you're studying.
00:14:15: I recall a few years ago, I
heard some interview or podcast
00:14:20: with you.
00:14:20: And you just threw out like I
don't know what I'll do next.
00:14:23: Maybe I'll be a scientist.
00:14:24: And I went yeah.
00:14:26: Because I knew-- because
I know you a bit.
00:14:29: And I see your work
out there, but we
00:14:30: had met before,
that if you decided
00:14:34: that you were going to do it--
00:14:35: and learning medicine,
which is what you're doing,
00:14:38: learning human physiology
is so detailed.
00:14:41: DAVID GOGGINS: Very.
00:14:42: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And people out there
00:14:43: have to understand when
you look at a textbook
00:14:45: and you see the veins and the
capillaries different colors,
00:14:49: when the body is open,
they're not different colors.
00:14:51: DAVID GOGGINS:
Right, right, right.
00:14:53: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
I mean, some things
00:14:54: have different color
contrasts, but it's not
00:14:56: like it's all labeled
when you pop it open.
00:14:58: DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly.
00:14:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the
process of writing things down
00:15:01: by hand is important for you.
00:15:03: So you go back and
read those notes.
00:15:04: Do you think about
that stuff on your runs
00:15:06: too or are you
segmenting your day
00:15:08: like when you're done studying,
are you heading out for a run
00:15:11: and thinking about other things?
00:15:12: Or are you still rehearsing
the material in your head?
00:15:16: DAVID GOGGINS: So when I write
it down, I write it down,
00:15:19: and I'm able to--
00:15:21: I'm actually looking
down at this table
00:15:22: right now because
I'm back to writing.
00:15:24: So I'm actually there right
now as I'm speaking to you.
00:15:27: I write it down in a way
that I'm memorizing page 69.
00:15:32: So I'm writing it down.
00:15:34: So then writing it down and that
page sync together in my brain.
00:15:38: So I'm looking at the book
in my brain right now.
00:15:42: That's just how it works for me.
00:15:44: And I have to do it
over and over again.
00:15:46: So that page is
stuck in my mind.
00:15:48: So I'm literally
flipping through pages
00:15:50: as I'm taking these tests.
00:15:52: And I'm taking these national
tests to become a paramedic
00:15:55: or become an advanced
EMT or whatever.
00:15:57: I'm literally as I'm taking
that test I'm going through.
00:16:01: And I'm like-- now I'm
flipping pages in my head
00:16:05: where that page was.
00:16:06: And how I do that is
just from how I write it
00:16:09: and how it's on the page.
00:16:11: When I run, I can't
recall any of it.
00:16:16: I cannot bring any of
that because I'm running.
00:16:20: How my mind is wired now is that
everything I do is what I do.
00:16:25: Because the focus it takes for
me to-- right now, I'm running.
00:16:29: I'm not like a great runner.
00:16:31: I'm not like injury free.
00:16:33: So like my first 20 minutes
of the run I'm limping.
00:16:37: I'm literally
limping because I've
00:16:39: had several knee surgeries.
00:16:41: And my body was twisted.
00:16:43: And so now it's untwisting.
00:16:45: So people look at me, oh, looks,
like he's limping when he runs.
00:16:49: I am limping when I run.
00:16:50: My body is jacked
up so I'm focusing
00:16:52: on how to get the best
out of a broken body.
00:16:56: So everything I do
is a total focus
00:16:59: on what I'm doing at
that point in my life.
00:17:01: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it
seems like you've really
00:17:03: trained away or somehow
gotten away from the ADD
00:17:07: that you mentioned
because what you described
00:17:09: is like a deep trench.
00:17:10: It's like a V shaped trench.
00:17:11: I'm imagining like
there's a ball bearing,
00:17:13: and it's like, phewp, and it can
only go forward in that trench
00:17:16: or back.
00:17:17: And it goes forward.
00:17:18: It's not like sliding around
at the concave at the bottom,
00:17:21: zip-zip-zip, like a tension.
00:17:23: So it's like you
trained that up.
00:17:25: Is there a similar
feeling when you're
00:17:27: in the full focus of running
versus full focus of studying?
00:17:31: Does it kind of
feel like, oh yeah,
00:17:33: that's the same groove but
different thing or is it
00:17:36: just completely different world?
00:17:38: DAVID GOGGINS: It's a
completely different world.
00:17:41: Both of them for
me is suffering,
00:17:43: but it's suffering a
whole different way.
00:17:45: Like when I was going through
school, I never forget--
00:17:48: I think I was in third grade.
00:17:51: And back then, ADD, ADHD,
wasn't like here's this medicine
00:17:57: or here's this thing.
00:17:58: They want to put you
in a special school.
00:18:00: So for me, I was so
far behind in learning
00:18:04: that their big thing
was let's just put him
00:18:06: in a special school
because he'll never learn.
00:18:09: And through that
process of like I
00:18:12: don't want to be in
a special school,
00:18:14: I don't want to be treated
any differently, it really--
00:18:18: like I never took medication.
00:18:20: I've never taken
medication for this.
00:18:22: That's why right now you see
me looking right in your eyes.
00:18:24: What the hell is Huberman
saying right now.
00:18:28: And that's why I don't feel
bad for people who have ADHD,
00:18:32: who have learning disabilities.
00:18:34: And some are impossible
because you just can't.
00:18:38: But a lot of them you can.
00:18:41: But people don't want to go
through the process of focus,
00:18:45: of teaching yourself
how to truly focus.
00:18:47: This is where my
message gets lost.
00:18:49: It gets lost because I may
say MF or F because that's
00:18:54: the passion that
comes out of me.
00:18:57: It takes everything for
me to learn a sentence.
00:19:02: So when I speak
about David Goggins,
00:19:04: I can't speak about David
Goggins in a way that's
00:19:07: just calm and cool.
00:19:09: Because when I wake
up, I know the journey
00:19:11: that it takes for me
to find my greatness.
00:19:13: And it's hard.
00:19:15: Nothing is easy.
00:19:17: Nothing just like, oh, I
wake up, and I just do this
00:19:19: or I do that or it just--
no, I watch people every day
00:19:23: go through life,
and it's so easy.
00:19:25: For me to be where I'm at
today, it takes every bit of me.
00:19:30: So when I speak about it,
and as I get going here,
00:19:33: you'll start seeing me--
the tempo will rise.
00:19:35: The passion will come out
because I'm back there.
00:19:38: I'm doing what I do every
day to become a human being.
00:19:41: And so nothing is easy.
00:19:44: Like running is running.
00:19:45: It sucks.
00:19:46: But you have a choice to make.
00:19:48: Do you want to sit down and go
back to that guy you once were?
00:19:52: No.
00:19:53: So this is what it takes.
00:19:55: It takes that
misunderstanding of people.
00:19:58: And they'll never get it because
they were never David Goggins.
00:20:01: So that is what it takes
for me to do what I do.
00:20:03: It may take you
something differently.
00:20:05: So for me, everything
has to be in the study.
00:20:07: Everything has to be into this.
00:20:08: Everything has to
be in-- everywhere
00:20:10: I am it has to be there,
me, focused where I am.
00:20:13: That's why you're
my second podcast
00:20:15: I've done since Rogan,
since the book came out.
00:20:17: I don't have time for that shit
because if I want to be great,
00:20:21: I'm not trying to maximize money
or maximize people knowing me.
00:20:25: I do these things because
maybe someone out there will
00:20:29: understand me and get it and
say, I can grow from this guy,
00:20:33: and others just won't.
00:20:35: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds
like friction is something
00:20:37: you're very familiar with.
00:20:39: It's a word just I feel
like is like cast above us
00:20:41: right now in bold face,
highlighted, underlined
00:20:44: letters.
00:20:44: DAVID GOGGINS:
Friction is growth.
00:20:45: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction,
like you're up in the morning.
00:20:48: And I imagine David Goggins
going to the coffee maker,
00:20:51: stretching out, good
morning, sunshine.
00:20:53: And you're telling me from
eyelids open there's friction.
00:20:57: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that
is the thing that people
00:20:59: don't-- they don't fucking get.
00:21:02: The biggest misunderstanding
about David Goggins
00:21:04: of all time--
00:21:05: it's like whether you
believe in God or not--
00:21:07: I do-- he put this lab rat,
which is me, on this planet
00:21:14: and said let me fucking
see what a beat up,
00:21:18: abused kid who can barely
learn, barely learn,
00:21:23: who has a twisted body, messed
up genetics, sickle cell, this
00:21:28: and that, let me
give him everything
00:21:31: that pretty much disqualifies
you from the military.
00:21:33: But back then, it wasn't as--
and let's put him in this
00:21:38: and see what comes out of it.
00:21:39: So to do that, friction--
00:21:42: you don't wake up
in the morning time
00:21:43: and go to the coffee maker.
00:21:45: Matter of fact, sometimes
you don't even sleep.
00:21:47: What it requires
is when I'm at--
00:21:50: 2 o'clock-- it's 2
o'clock in the morning.
00:21:52: And my brain is thinking
about a fucking drug.
00:21:55: And I got to get up
and look in my book
00:21:57: to see what that drug
is, how I remember it.
00:22:00: And this is every day
of my fucking life.
00:22:04: That's why when I train a
fighter or I train someone,
00:22:06: I'm like, you have no fucking
idea how great you really
00:22:09: are because you are
using such minimal,
00:22:14: minimal of what you have.
00:22:16: And if people can learn to
focus, this is what's possible.
00:22:21: While it may not
be pretty-- like
00:22:23: people want to do a
documentary on me.
00:22:24: I go no.
00:22:26: I don't want to do
a documentary on me
00:22:28: because I will have normal
everyday people picking me
00:22:32: apart.
00:22:33: Oh, his life is miserable.
00:22:35: Who wants to live like that?
00:22:38: It's crazy how he-- it's
almost like he's sick.
00:22:40: He's psychotic.
00:22:44: The most frustrating
thing in the world for me
00:22:46: is when normal people
judge a man like myself
00:22:50: on what it really takes to
extract greatness from nothing.
00:22:57: It takes every bit of who you
are if you choose that route.
00:23:02: If you don't, Merry Christmas,
do what you got to do.
00:23:06: But, yeah, all these
things for me--
00:23:09: like I told you, man, I'm
going to keep it real.
00:23:12: I'm not coming here to talk
about perform without purpose
00:23:18: because I go through--
00:23:19: when I write these
books, I go through,
00:23:22: I try to dumb down
David Goggins.
00:23:25: How can I give normal
people-- and I'm normal.
00:23:28: But I found something that
most don't want to find.
00:23:31: How can I speak to
people and give them
00:23:33: something from this crazy
psychotic brain that I've
00:23:36: developed?
00:23:37: How can I give them that?
00:23:38: So I sit down with
Jennifer for years
00:23:41: and write down perform
without purpose,
00:23:44: callus your mind, armor
your mind, the cookie jar,
00:23:48: the accountability mirror, shit
that people can fucking use
00:23:52: in their lives.
00:23:53: No, no, I'm glad it helps you.
00:23:57: But the barbaric life that I
live that you have to live,
00:24:02: the almost obsession that
you must have to be great,
00:24:06: you can't put that shit
in a fucking book, bro.
00:24:08: You can't put in a book.
00:24:10: You can't.
00:24:11: You can't write about it.
00:24:12: ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
has to be experienced.
00:24:13: DAVID GOGGINS: It has
to be experienced.
00:24:15: And you can't even--
00:24:16: after you experience it,
to write it in the book,
00:24:21: it would seem like he
needs to be locked up.
00:24:24: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory.
00:24:25: DAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory.
00:24:26: Doesn't make sense for
a guy that everything,
00:24:28: every second of the
day he is trying
00:24:31: to extract more from something.
00:24:34: He's constantly thinking.
00:24:36: He's constantly,
constantly disciplined,
00:24:38: never going off the path.
00:24:40: Whatever is injured on
him, he figures away.
00:24:43: It's a conquerors mindset.
00:24:46: And very few people, if any, can
really understand what that is.
00:24:52: Like I'm almost 50.
00:24:55: And I've been this way
for almost 30 years.
00:24:58: Like what do you do for fun?
00:25:02: These questions,
I don't get them.
00:25:04: I don't understand them.
00:25:05: I don't-- so yeah.
00:25:06: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get
asked that sometimes,
00:25:08: what do you do for fun.
00:25:08: I start listing off all this
stuff like podcasting, reading,
00:25:11: working out.
00:25:13: So some of that resonates.
00:25:15: But I think what's so
truly unusual about what
00:25:19: you're describing, your process
is that from go it's hard.
00:25:25: And I have to ask was being 300
pounds, having essentially--
00:25:29: I'm using the words
you've described.
00:25:31: DAVID GOGGINS: No, do it.
00:25:32: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You've said it before.
00:25:33: You had a tendency at one
point in your life early
00:25:35: on tell lies, try and
get people's approval.
00:25:38: DAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off.
00:25:40: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy
haircuts, attention seeking,
00:25:43: and yet all of that
triggered something
00:25:47: that now is extraordinary.
00:25:52: Do you think those
hardships were
00:25:56: necessary to flip the switch?
00:25:58: DAVID GOGGINS: I don't know
if they were necessary,
00:26:00: but it was something
that made me feel--
00:26:04: I didn't feel good.
00:26:06: It was easy.
00:26:08: The brain that I was
given as a child,
00:26:12: it was easy to go
home and think about,
00:26:14: how do I want to
be a freak today?
00:26:17: How do I want to show up to
school today and be a freak?
00:26:19: It didn't require me going home
and opening a book up saying,
00:26:23: it's going to take me all year
to learn this fucking page.
00:26:26: So instead of
learning that page,
00:26:29: I learned how to
become a character.
00:26:33: And maybe that character
that I created,
00:26:36: that 300 pound,
insecure guy that
00:26:39: used to fake it till
I make it type of guy,
00:26:43: let me become your
friend, let me lie to you
00:26:45: until you like me type of guy--
00:26:48: when you have any manhood,
womanhood, a human being,
00:26:55: a soul, a spirit, any--
00:26:58: I must have just this much
pride because that's exactly
00:27:02: what opened the door for me.
00:27:03: Because every day,
you were a character.
00:27:05: Every day, you were a clown.
00:27:06: Every day, you opened that
Spanish book or that science
00:27:11: book or English book,
and you looked at it.
00:27:13: It looked like a
foreign language.
00:27:17: And you're saying,
where do I start?
00:27:20: Where do I start?
00:27:21: And, obviously,
it was necessary.
00:27:24: The more I talk about it, it
was necessary because what
00:27:26: happened is I became
haunted by the mere fact
00:27:31: that this is my existence.
00:27:33: And you got to live with that.
00:27:35: And I lived with it
for a lot of years.
00:27:38: And so I sat back and
said, OK, all right,
00:27:41: I know what this takes.
00:27:42: And when you sit back,
as fucked up as I was--
00:27:46: and I had a laundry
list, a table
00:27:50: like this of what I
have to do to become
00:27:53: just a human being that
can make ends meet,
00:27:57: that can make $1,000 a month.
00:27:59: Just to get there was like,
oh my god, dude, like how--
00:28:03: I'm 16, 17, I can't read.
00:28:06: I can't write.
00:28:09: Oh my god, I'm so
behind the power curve.
00:28:11: And my brain is about
being depressed.
00:28:13: And my dad beat--
my mom's not home.
00:28:15: And kids are calling
me nigger at school.
00:28:17: And I'm like, oh my god,
man, what the fuck do I do?
00:28:21: And it wasn't like someone
came around and said,
00:28:23: hey, man, you can do this.
00:28:26: This is all me.
00:28:28: Some people want to know where
does this cold man come from.
00:28:32: I'm not trying to be cold.
00:28:34: It's the reality of my life.
00:28:36: It's the reality of a
lot of people's lives.
00:28:39: And so, yeah, that had to
happen for me to be haunted,
00:28:43: to be haunted, to
pull out, to extract
00:28:46: the guy that I am today.
00:28:47: That haunting is something
that's still there today
00:28:51: because no matter
how much you improve,
00:28:53: no matter how much you
change who you are,
00:28:57: it's not permanent.
00:28:59: You don't just wake up
and say, oh my god, man,
00:29:03: you're David Goggins.
00:29:04: You break records.
00:29:05: You do this.
00:29:05: You do that.
00:29:06: People want to know, how are
you able to just be so hard?
00:29:12: Because I never turn
the fucking thing off.
00:29:14: Because once it turns
off, I go right back
00:29:17: to the David Goggins that is.
00:29:19: And that's the guy that I'm
constantly fighting every day.
00:29:23: And it's a choice.
00:29:24: And that choice makes
you misunderstood.
00:29:27: It makes you crazy.
00:29:28: That's why I hate
fucking social media.
00:29:31: In 2013, people wanted
me to write my book.
00:29:35: I did it in 2018.
00:29:37: Took five years.
00:29:39: And the reason why
I didn't do it--
00:29:40: I sat at the table,
and Jennifer was there.
00:29:42: This was before she
started working for me,
00:29:45: I started dating
her or whatever.
00:29:47: And all these people were there.
00:29:48: And they're like, man, you
got to go on social media.
00:29:51: And I was like, fuck you, man.
00:29:54: It's poison.
00:29:56: It's poison because I knew
what I did to get where I am.
00:30:00: And I'm going to
have these people,
00:30:01: these normal, everyday
people, fat, lazy,
00:30:06: exactly who I was judging me.
00:30:11: Because I know it
because I was once them.
00:30:13: All my hard work,
all my dedication,
00:30:15: I'm going to have
some normal dude get
00:30:17: his little brownie, his little
Ding Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie,
00:30:20: sit there with his
coffee picking me apart.
00:30:24: Oh, he must be unhappy.
00:30:27: Do you know how hard it
is to put these shoes
00:30:29: on every damn morning?
00:30:30: And I'm gonna have
you pick me apart?
00:30:33: So, yeah, there's so
much that goes into this
00:30:39: that I was like fuck this.
00:30:42: I never wanted
anything to do with it.
00:30:44: So anyway.
00:30:48: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
not a psychologist.
00:30:50: But knowing your story
from what you've written,
00:30:53: what you've said
on social media,
00:30:54: and elsewhere, podcasts and
here now especially, it's
00:30:58: amazing to me, and,
frankly, it pulls
00:31:00: at my heartstrings
a little bit I
00:31:02: realize that's not what
you're trying to do
00:31:04: but that in the course of your
childhood and in your young
00:31:07: adulthood that no one ever
got between you and the world.
00:31:11: I forget where I heard it
that if a kid has just one
00:31:14: person that believes in them--
00:31:16: and I had my trials
and tribulations.
00:31:17: But I had great
coaches, great mentors.
00:31:20: I attached to them.
00:31:21: I found them if they
didn't necessarily find me.
00:31:23: But I'm realizing that your
situation was no one's ever
00:31:28: said, hey, I'm going to
stand here next to you
00:31:30: or get in front of
you, put a shield up.
00:31:33: And so it's almost like
you've got these different--
00:31:39: it's all you, but there's
versions of yourself--
00:31:41: that like you knew social
media-- like I don't know
00:31:44: that I have the wherewithal
in 2013 '14, '15, '16,
00:31:47: '17 to get in front
of myself while doing
00:31:50: all this because I've already
got so much going on in here.
00:31:53: Is that about right?
00:31:53: DAVID GOGGINS: That is right.
00:31:55: But I had developed
a lot of anger.
00:31:57: And I still have it.
00:31:58: And it will never go away
for the normal human beings
00:32:02: of this world because when
you put yourself in the sewer
00:32:06: like I was in-- and please,
if someone saved me,
00:32:09: come out and announce
it to the world.
00:32:12: There was no one.
00:32:14: There's no one.
00:32:16: So when you know that--
00:32:18: and then I'm
sitting at the table
00:32:20: with all these smart
people who are telling
00:32:21: me what to do and shit and
guiding me through my life
00:32:24: now when I'm 40
fucking years old.
00:32:27: It's 2000-- I don't know
40-something years old.
00:32:30: Now I'm 49.
00:32:31: And I'm looking at them all.
00:32:32: And they're now
trying to guide me
00:32:34: on what's right on this poison.
00:32:39: And so, yeah, what
you say is right.
00:32:41: But for me, it was
more of I know now.
00:32:46: I don't need you
to guide my future.
00:32:50: I know what's good for
me and what's bad for me.
00:32:53: And for me, it took every
bit of focus I could.
00:32:56: And I know social media--
00:32:57: that's why people love to go on
there because they want to show
00:33:01: you the good side of life.
00:33:05: I'm not teaching
good side of life.
00:33:07: So I had to figure
out a way when
00:33:09: I came on 2016 of teaching
you what life really is
00:33:14: for the majority of us is hell.
00:33:17: And so while people love to show
you the cars, and the house,
00:33:22: and the vacations and
shit, all that's good.
00:33:25: All that's happy.
00:33:27: I'm going to show you the
side that I know most of you
00:33:30: are going through.
00:33:31: And people hide very well.
00:33:33: I don't want to hide anymore.
00:33:35: I hid it for 24 fucking years.
00:33:38: So that's why now
when I told you
00:33:39: we can talk about
whatever you want
00:33:41: because as human beings, the
first thing we have to learn--
00:33:46: I also stuttered
real bad growing up.
00:33:47: So if you hear me stutter
every now and then,
00:33:49: it's because that was
part of my life also.
00:33:53: So it's funny.
00:33:55: Human beings want to
show you the best side.
00:33:57: And they want to
hide the worst side.
00:33:59: For me, I'm going
to teach you how
00:34:01: to be vulnerable because that's
the only way you fix yourself.
00:34:05: You don't fix yourself
by coming out here
00:34:07: and me selling you
some fucking books.
00:34:09: That's why I don't have them.
00:34:11: I forgot them.
00:34:13: I'm glad people got
something from the book.
00:34:16: I want you to learn that
the only way you grow
00:34:21: is how to look at
yourself and say, OK,
00:34:24: like I did, table longer than
this, what the fuck I have
00:34:28: to do to get somewhere?
00:34:30: There was nothing good
on there, nothing.
00:34:32: Yeah, I loved
playing basketball.
00:34:34: I left that out.
00:34:35: That's something I love to do.
00:34:37: I don't care about that.
00:34:38: That didn't make
the fucking list
00:34:40: because the list
that I had to live by
00:34:42: was the very list that was
going to get me at this table
00:34:45: with you to talk to you to
the normal human beings, which
00:34:50: I once was, about how you can
get somewhere and how it looks.
00:34:55: It looks very ugly.
00:34:58: There's no fucking passion.
00:35:00: There's no fucking motivation.
00:35:02: There's no, oh my
god, man, I fucking--
00:35:05: no, it's every day of
your life just doing,
00:35:11: no passion, no discipline, no
motivation, all these words.
00:35:15: I hate that so many people
fucking use these words now
00:35:17: because it's watered.
00:35:20: Someone sitting in
the room by themselves
00:35:22: and they figure themselves
out and say, god, this
00:35:24: is going to fucking suck.
00:35:27: Where's passion when
you're 300 pounds?
00:35:31: Where's the motivation when
you can't read and write?
00:35:33: Where is it?
00:35:34: So how did this happen?
00:35:36: I just fucking did.
00:35:38: I just did.
00:35:40: I said maybe at the
end of this journey,
00:35:41: there will be
something there for me.
00:35:43: If not, I can read.
00:35:46: If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds.
00:35:50: There was no magic potion.
00:35:52: There was no, oh, let me wake
up and look at some shit.
00:35:55: No.
00:35:56: All those words are overused.
00:35:58: They're bullshit.
00:35:59: It's all bullshit.
00:36:01: Just do.
00:36:02: You're living.
00:36:03: How do you want to live?
00:36:05: How do you want to die?
00:36:06: How do you want to
fucking be remembered?
00:36:09: That's it.
00:36:11: That's it.
00:36:12: Period.
00:36:13: ANDREW HUBERMAN: As
many of you know,
00:36:15: I've been taking AG1
daily since 2012.
00:36:17: So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
00:36:20: AG1 is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink
00:36:22: that's designed to meet all
of your foundational nutrition
00:36:25: needs.
00:36:25: Now, of course, I try to get
enough servings of vitamins
00:36:28: and minerals through whole foods
sources that include vegetables
00:36:30: and fruits every day.
00:36:31: But, oftentimes, I simply
can't get enough servings.
00:36:34: But with AG1, I'm sure to get
enough vitamins, and minerals,
00:36:37: and the probiotics that I need.
00:36:39: And it also contains adaptogens
to help buffer stress.
00:36:42: Simply put, I always feel
better when I take AG1.
00:36:45: I have more focus and
energy, and I sleep better.
00:36:47: And it also happens
to taste great.
00:36:50: For all these
reasons, whenever I'm
00:36:51: asked if you could take just
one supplement what would it be,
00:36:54: I answer AG1.
00:36:56: If you'd like to try AG1, go to
drinkag1.com/huberman to claim
00:37:01: a special offer.
00:37:02: They'll give you
five free travel
00:37:04: packs plus a year's
supply of vitamin D3, K2.
00:37:07: Again, that's
drinkag1.com/huberman.
00:37:10: The word haunted is
ringing in my head.
00:37:13: DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.
00:37:15: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
it's such a powerful word.
00:37:17: DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.
00:37:18: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Because I was about to m
00:37:21: it seems like a huge part
of your process, maybe
00:37:24: the entire process, is
it's all stick no carrot,
00:37:27: you talk about the carrot,
the positive thing.
00:37:29: And then there's the stick, the
thing you're trying to avoid.
00:37:32: I feel like it's-- the way
it's landing for me is it's all
00:37:38: stick and gas pedal.
00:37:39: DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.
00:37:40: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's no carrot.
00:37:41: You're not imagining, oh,
when I'm a paramedic, when
00:37:44: the book is published.
00:37:45: And, obviously, you
set those goals,
00:37:47: and you make those targets.
00:37:48: But it's all stick.
00:37:49: DAVID GOGGINS: All stick.
00:37:51: ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot.
00:37:52: DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that.
00:37:54: I'm waking up
right now studying.
00:37:56: Like I have a test tomorrow.
00:37:59: I already passed
the fucking test.
00:38:01: Think about that.
00:38:03: Every day in my life,
that's what I must do just
00:38:06: to retain what I learned.
00:38:09: Four hours plus a day, I
go through and do that.
00:38:13: There's no stick.
00:38:14: Or there's only a stick.
00:38:16: There's never been
a carrot, which
00:38:18: is why when I speak to
people, I have to figure out
00:38:25: a way to resonate with them.
00:38:27: Because all I want
to say to them
00:38:30: is let me teach you the
real life, how it really is.
00:38:35: The reason why you're a loser
and the reason why you're not
00:38:37: fucking making it and
the reason why you're
00:38:40: trying to go to all these--
00:38:41: I go to all these
fucking conventions,
00:38:42: speak all the fucking time.
00:38:44: I look in the fucking audience.
00:38:46: And these people
sign up, sign up,
00:38:48: sign up fucking every
year go to a convention,
00:38:50: thinking they're going to learn
something fucking different.
00:38:53: No, you're lazy.
00:38:55: You know exactly what to
do, exactly what to do.
00:38:58: Because even me in my state
of I can't read and write,
00:39:03: I knew exactly what to do.
00:39:06: It just sucks doing it.
00:39:08: It sucks to do it.
00:39:10: It sucks to wake up every
morning of your life
00:39:13: and say, god, man,
I'm not smart.
00:39:16: So guess what I got to do.
00:39:18: I got to study the same shit
that I got one of the highest
00:39:21: scores in the nation on and
do it again, and do it again,
00:39:26: and do it again.
00:39:27: It's not just there.
00:39:28: It's not just there
permanently for me.
00:39:30: So, yeah, it's all stick.
00:39:33: It's all stick.
00:39:35: The only carrot you have
is like maybe, maybe.
00:39:42: Because whenever I take these
tests that are real hard,
00:39:45: the back of my brain
is like a good chance
00:39:48: you're not going to
make it, Goggins.
00:39:50: This ain't you, bro.
00:39:52: This ain't you.
00:39:53: You weren't born like this.
00:39:55: This ain't you.
00:39:56: The real you, bro--
00:39:58: study all you want to.
00:39:59: But the second that
fucking computer
00:40:00: comes on with 150 questions,
this ain't you, man.
00:40:05: And somehow, comes back.
00:40:07: I passed.
00:40:08: I passed again, passed again.
00:40:11: But that real me back
here every fucking time
00:40:14: is saying that ain't you, bro.
00:40:17: That ain't you.
00:40:19: And I have to
outwork that voice.
00:40:22: When I'm taking
that test and I get
00:40:24: to a question I don't
fucking know the answer,
00:40:26: I'm like fuck, man.
00:40:27: And then say, see
I told you, man.
00:40:30: That ain't you.
00:40:33: You're 300 pounds, man.
00:40:34: You sit at home.
00:40:34: You figure out how
to do your hair.
00:40:36: That's what you do,
how to come to school
00:40:38: with the reverse
baldness when you're 16.
00:40:42: That's you.
00:40:44: So there is no get
out of jail free card.
00:40:49: This is why I say stay hard.
00:40:51: Because when you
weren't given the gifts,
00:40:54: the only thing you can
do in life is stay hard.
00:40:58: And I know people
cannot stand me.
00:41:01: They can't stand this talk.
00:41:04: This is all you can do.
00:41:07: There's no magic pill
or a magic potion.
00:41:10: All you can do is
outwork the man
00:41:14: that God created
or woman in you.
00:41:17: And what that looks
like is unfun.
00:41:20: That's why I said, do not
do a documentary on me
00:41:24: because people will
not see the truth.
00:41:27: They will see what
they want to see is
00:41:29: I don't want to live like that.
00:41:31: Good, good.
00:41:33: And you will live
exactly the way
00:41:35: you live now,
questioning who you are,
00:41:38: wondering what is
possible, wondering
00:41:40: what you are capable of doing.
00:41:42: That's how that looks or you
can be me, which am I happy?
00:41:48: I don't know.
00:41:48: Never really thought about it.
00:41:50: Don't really care about
it because all I really
00:41:51: cared about was when I looked
in that fucking mirror,
00:41:54: I saw a piece of shit.
00:41:55: Happiness wasn't on the mirror
at 16 or when I was 300 pounds.
00:41:59: It wasn't like, I'm
looking for happiness.
00:42:02: No, I'm looking at myself in
the mirror and say, all right,
00:42:05: motherfucker, you
did it again today.
00:42:08: You're a bad boy
because that shit sucks.
00:42:11: I have about a couple of minutes
of that that I got the carrot.
00:42:16: The second I lay down and
go to bed, the carrots gone
00:42:18: because I'm waking up all
through the night to check
00:42:21: the work I did that day.
00:42:24: Did I get this drug right?
00:42:25: Did I get this right?
00:42:26: Did I get that right?
00:42:28: What did I do?
00:42:29: Oh my god, fuck, I'm
already losing it.
00:42:33: Stick.
00:42:35: ANDREW HUBERMAN: That
stick's haunting you.
00:42:37: DAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me.
00:42:38: ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
following you around.
00:42:39: So no picture of
Jordan on the wall.
00:42:41: You're not listening to
YouTube inspiration video.
00:42:43: DAVID GOGGINS: No.
00:42:44: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would
be all your voice anyway.
00:42:46: [LAUGHTER]
00:42:47: You're not listening to
your top 10 favorite songs
00:42:50: just to get rolling and then
lace the shoes, hit the books.
00:42:54: It's all in here.
00:42:55: DAVID GOGGINS: All in there.
00:42:56: I used to do that
when I was fat.
00:42:58: Rocky, I mean,
that was my thing.
00:43:01: Round 14 was my thing.
00:43:03: And as I got older and older and
older, that started to go away.
00:43:09: And I started to create--
00:43:13: I had all these people
that I used to watch.
00:43:15: Rocky was one, Barnes,
Elias from "Platoon,"
00:43:21: Jack from "A Few Good Men" when
he's on the stand going crazy.
00:43:25: I saw a lot of these
characters that I looked at
00:43:28: and I was like, man, I
ain't got none of that.
00:43:31: But they were characters.
00:43:33: After a while, I lived
a life so disciplined
00:43:38: that every body
that I once looked
00:43:40: to, these fake characters,
I built that as a man.
00:43:46: And when I was younger, I
had this image in my mind
00:43:50: of what does a man
look like to me?
00:43:52: And I got all these people
who are badasses, characters.
00:43:58: And in my mind, I became that.
00:44:01: And that's what kept
me going a lot was
00:44:04: I had this pipe dream of
becoming a little bit of this
00:44:07: and a little bit of
that because when
00:44:08: you have no parents
raising you and you
00:44:11: have no role models growing
up, it's not daydreaming.
00:44:16: You start to create a reality
like, mm, maybe I can be that.
00:44:25: And after becoming
this guy, that
00:44:31: is the biggest thing I
can ever do in my life is
00:44:33: I became that guy.
00:44:35: That I once looked at
all these, guys and now
00:44:37: I look at myself like, god,
who the fuck can do that?
00:44:39: I can.
00:44:41: But what it takes
is a discipline
00:44:43: that no one can ever even--
00:44:48: they don't understand it.
00:44:49: They don't understand it.
00:44:50: But everybody has
the ability to do it,
00:44:52: but they just don't want to.
00:44:53: They want to keep
asking questions
00:44:55: and keep going to seminars.
00:44:57: And the greatness
is right in you.
00:44:59: And that's why once again--
00:45:00: I say this a million times here,
I do not feel sorry for you.
00:45:04: I will not sugarcoat
what I'm going
00:45:07: to say to you because
all of you know
00:45:09: what I'm saying is the truth.
00:45:12: Everybody knows it's the truth.
00:45:14: This is what it looks like.
00:45:15: And you know it too.
00:45:16: You know it too.
00:45:18: If you ain't got nothing, I hate
to tell you what it looks like.
00:45:20: It's ugly.
00:45:21: It's not a documentary.
00:45:22: It's not an HBO special.
00:45:24: You ain't going to
watch me like, hey, man,
00:45:25: you guys gotta watch this.
00:45:26: No, it's like, oh, god, this
looks like a train wreck.
00:45:28: It's like a nightmare.
00:45:29: This looks like this guy's got--
no, that's what it looks like.
00:45:32: Hard work looks horrible.
00:45:34: It's not motivating.
00:45:36: It's not motivating at all.
00:45:37: It ain't like Rocky round 14
where he gets knocked down
00:45:40: and goes like this
to Apollo Creed.
00:45:42: Looks like a man being
stuck in a fucking dungeon.
00:45:45: And there's no fucking way out.
00:45:48: But you have the fucking key.
00:45:52: But you refuse to use it.
00:45:55: And that's nothing
motivating about that.
00:45:57: So, yes, no documentary
on David Goggins.
00:46:00: ANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life--
00:46:01: DAVID GOGGINS: The real life.
00:46:02: ANDREW HUBERMAN: --David
Goggins is the documentary.
00:46:04: It's already being written.
00:46:07: You're it.
00:46:08: DAVID GOGGINS: Right.
00:46:08: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm going
to share a little neuroscience
00:46:10: tidbit.
00:46:11: DAVID GOGGINS: Love it.
00:46:11: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But I think it's one
00:46:13: that you'll appreciate.
00:46:14: Most people don't
know this, but there's
00:46:16: a brain structure called the
anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
00:46:20: As we pointed out
before, that's a noun.
00:46:22: It's a name.
00:46:22: It doesn't mean anything.
00:46:23: We could call it
the Cookie Monster.
00:46:26: But what's interesting
about this brain
00:46:28: area is there are
now a lot of data
00:46:31: in humans, not some mouse study,
showing that when people do
00:46:36: something they don't
want to do like add three
00:46:39: hours of exercise
per day or per week
00:46:43: or when people who are trying
to diet and lose weight
00:46:46: resist eating something,
when people do anything
00:46:49: that they, and this
is the important part,
00:46:51: that they don't want to do,
it's not about adding more work.
00:46:54: It's about adding more work
that you don't want to do.
00:46:58: This brain area gets bigger.
00:47:00: Now here's what's especially
interesting about this brain
00:47:02: area to me.
00:47:03: And by the way, I'm
only learning this
00:47:04: recently because it's new data.
00:47:07: But there's a lot of it.
00:47:08: The anterior
mid-cingulate cortex
00:47:11: is smaller in obese people.
00:47:14: It gets bigger when they diet.
00:47:17: It's larger in athletes.
00:47:20: It's especially
large or grows larger
00:47:23: in people that see
themselves as challenged
00:47:27: and overcome some challenge.
00:47:30: And in people that
live a very long time,
00:47:35: this area keeps its size.
00:47:38: In many ways,
scientists are starting
00:47:40: to think of the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex not just
00:47:43: as one of the seats of
willpower but perhaps actually
00:47:48: the seat of the will to live.
00:47:50: DAVID GOGGINS: See,
now we're talking.
00:47:52: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And when I learned
00:47:52: about the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex,
00:47:54: I was like almost
out of my seat.
00:47:55: And I've been in the
neuroscience game
00:47:57: since I was 20.
00:47:58: DAVID GOGGINS:
Now we're talking.
00:47:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
We're the same age.
00:47:59: And I was so pumped because I've
heard of the amygdala, fear,
00:48:02: prefrontal cortex.
00:48:03: It's planning an action.
00:48:04: I could tell you every
brain area and every--
00:48:06: I teach neuroanatomy
to medical students.
00:48:08: But when I started
seeing the data
00:48:11: on the anterior mid-cingulate
cortex, I was like, whoa,
00:48:16: this is interesting.
00:48:18: And all the data
point to the fact
00:48:20: that we can build this area up.
00:48:22: But that as quickly
as we build it up,
00:48:25: if we don't continue to invest
in things that are hard for us,
00:48:29: that we don't want to
do-- that's the part that
00:48:31: feels so Goggin-esque to me,
that we don't want to do.
00:48:35: Like if you love the ice bath--
yeah, I love the ice bath--
00:48:38: and you go from 1
minute to 10 minutes,
00:48:40: guess what, your anterior
mid-cingulate cortex did not
00:48:42: grow.
00:48:43: DAVID GOGGINS: None.
00:48:44: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if
you hate the cold water,
00:48:46: if you're afraid of drowning
and you get into water
00:48:49: and put your head
under and survive,
00:48:54: then the anterior mid-cingulate
cortex gets bigger.
00:48:56: But if you don't do it the next
day or if you do it the next
00:48:59: day and you enjoy it because,
hey, hey, I did it yesterday,
00:49:02: woo-hoo, happy me, Merry
Christmas as you would say--
00:49:04: DAVID GOGGINS: Right.
00:49:05: Merry Christmas.
00:49:06: ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess
what, the anterior
00:49:07: mid-cingulate cortex
shrinks again.
00:49:10: To me, this is one of the
most important discoveries
00:49:12: that neuroscience has
ever made because it's
00:49:16: that I don't want to do
something but do it anyway
00:49:19: that grows this area.
00:49:21: And it's almost like--
00:49:22: I have a friend.
00:49:23: He's been sober 30
years from alcohol.
00:49:25: And he always says, the
amazing thing about addiction
00:49:27: is there's a cure.
00:49:29: The problem is it only
works one day at a time.
00:49:32: And so you have to
renew it every day.
00:49:34: DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.
00:49:35: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex to me--
00:49:37: when I learned about it, two
things went off in my head.
00:49:40: Whoa, this is super interesting.
00:49:41: And, two, I got to tell
David Goggins about this.
00:49:43: And I waited until now--
00:49:45: DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad.
00:49:46: ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell
you because I felt like, well,
00:49:48: for obvious reasons
I wanted to tell you
00:49:50: and I wanted to tell you here.
00:49:51: DAVID GOGGINS: Well, I
love that because that's
00:49:54: how I've lived my entire life.
00:49:55: I don't know
anything about that.
00:49:57: But people go, man, you
have such a strong will.
00:50:01: It's something that you build.
00:50:03: Like I never forget I was
on a podcast one time.
00:50:05: And this dude goes you were
blessed with a strong mind.
00:50:10: Like the hell are
you talking about I
00:50:15: was blessed with a strong mind?
00:50:17: That's something that
you have to develop.
00:50:20: You develop that over
years, decades of suffering
00:50:25: and going back into the suffer.
00:50:28: That's why a lot of people who
graduate Navy SEAL training,
00:50:31: they want to know--
00:50:35: I talk about it very
openly all the time.
00:50:39: A lot of guys don't want
to go back into that water,
00:50:42: don't want to go back
into the hard stuff.
00:50:44: And maybe not-- anything
hard, anything hard
00:50:47: in life, once you get through
it, it's like you become a POW.
00:50:52: Like how many POWs you know
want to go back to POW camp?
00:50:55: None.
00:50:56: When something sucks
so bad in life--
00:50:59: this is on this that
we're talking about now--
00:51:03: very few people want to go back.
00:51:05: They're happy they graduated.
00:51:09: I realized I'm the same way.
00:51:12: I don't want to go back.
00:51:14: I have to go back.
00:51:16: I must go back because that is
exactly where all the knowledge
00:51:21: of my life exists was back
there in what you're exactly
00:51:25: what you're talking about.
00:51:26: Well, I didn't know
anything about this.
00:51:28: But how I grew a will was
constantly doing these things
00:51:33: to now it's just life.
00:51:37: I wake up.
00:51:37: While it still sucks,
it's just life.
00:51:40: You don't sit back
and like, oh my god.
00:51:42: Like I have days I
don't want to do.
00:51:44: But I know I'm going to do it.
00:51:46: I know from years
of just doing it.
00:51:49: So that's beautiful.
00:51:51: And this is why I came
on here with you today.
00:51:53: And I'm glad that you're talking
about this because human beings
00:51:56: need to hear this.
00:51:58: They need to stop hearing
these hacks on this and that.
00:52:03: There's no fucking hack, bro.
00:52:05: There's no fucking hack.
00:52:06: Yeah, you may this and that
and saunas and all this shit
00:52:11: that they-- yeah, it's great.
00:52:13: There is no fucking life hack.
00:52:16: To grow that thing--
how do you grow it?
00:52:19: Do it, and do it,
and do it, and do it.
00:52:23: That's the hack.
00:52:24: The hack is going
to fucking suck.
00:52:26: And that's what I realized.
00:52:28: That's what I realized.
00:52:29: That's why I wanted
to come on here today.
00:52:31: I didn't want to
come on here and talk
00:52:33: about no fucking
passion and purpose
00:52:35: and how to get the
fuck out of bed
00:52:37: and how to hit a
fucking alarm clock,
00:52:39: all this catchphrase bullshit
because that wasn't how
00:52:43: I lived, wasn't how I lived.
00:52:46: I lived, I woke up like
every human being does
00:52:48: and goes fuck, man.
00:52:49: I'm a fucking piece
of shit today.
00:52:51: How the hell is this
going to work out for me?
00:52:53: And you fight that.
00:52:55: And you fight that.
00:52:56: You don't override it.
00:52:57: There's no override button.
00:52:59: It's the conversation
in your head.
00:53:02: So how do you do that?
00:53:04: We don't have enough
of these conversations
00:53:06: about the real conversation that
every human being is having.
00:53:10: And they have no idea
how to get out of it.
00:53:12: But they do is that
shit right there, man.
00:53:16: You got to build your will.
00:53:18: How you build your will?
00:53:20: Exactly what you said, man.
00:53:21: Exactly what you said.
00:53:23: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I feel like knowing
00:53:25: the name of something,
anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
00:53:27: doesn't fundamentally change us.
00:53:29: But one thing I
like about biology
00:53:31: is that willpower, if somebody
feels they don't have it,
00:53:36: feels like this thing
that other people have.
00:53:38: But everybody, unless
they're brain-damaged,
00:53:40: like a hole through their
head, has two anterior
00:53:45: mid-cingulate cortex, one
on each side of their brain.
00:53:48: Everyone has one.
00:53:49: They have two.
00:53:50: So I feel like it's just a
question of opening the portal.
00:53:55: And the portal-- again,
I'm going to say 10 times,
00:53:59: and forgive me--
is I think people
00:54:00: go, oh, I do hard things.
00:54:01: I do sets to failure.
00:54:03: And then I do forced reps.
00:54:04: I love training with weights.
00:54:06: I love doing sets to failure.
00:54:07: I even like forced reps.
00:54:08: But guess what?
00:54:09: I like forced reps.
00:54:10: So I'll tell you,
they don't build
00:54:12: my anterior mid-cingulate
cortex because I like to do it.
00:54:16: Anything you like
to do is not going
00:54:18: to enhance this
aspect of willpower.
00:54:20: And it seems so obvious
once you hear it.
00:54:22: You kind of go, oh
yeah, of course.
00:54:24: But I think you really
close that loop for people
00:54:29: when you share what
you're sharing today
00:54:32: and what you've shared
elsewhere before as well.
00:54:34: When you're trying to
explain the friction
00:54:36: is the critical ingredient.
00:54:38: And I think people think,
oh, if it's effort, well,
00:54:40: then I'm getting better.
00:54:41: That's part of it, necessary,
but not sufficient,
00:54:44: as we say in science.
00:54:45: But the suck part, the haunt,
being haunted, the stick,
00:54:52: they're really unpleasant terms.
00:54:53: These are probably the most
unpleasant terms we've ever
00:54:56: used on this podcast.
00:54:58: Those are the--
those are the levers.
00:55:01: Those are the gears.
00:55:02: And without those, this thing
that you're talking about,
00:55:05: David Goggins, as a verb--
00:55:08: I sometimes make the
joke, but it's not a joke.
00:55:11: Goggins is a name,
and it's a verb.
00:55:15: People go, I'm on
to Goggins that.
00:55:17: But that's, I think--
00:55:20: again, I'm not a psychologist.
00:55:21: But I think that's what
you're talking about,
00:55:23: the stick, the
friction, being haunted.
00:55:26: It's the suck part that grows
this anterior mid-cingulate
00:55:29: cortex.
00:55:30: DAVID GOGGINS: So
now you know why
00:55:32: there's so many people
that fail in this world
00:55:35: to figure out their purpose,
their purpose in life.
00:55:40: Where do I go?
00:55:41: Because to grow that, now,
you may not look like me,
00:55:48: how my daily life looks.
00:55:50: It don't look fun.
00:55:53: Don't look fun.
00:55:56: So it's a choice that
people have to make in life.
00:55:59: But what's so funny about it
is even the richest of rich,
00:56:02: who have everything, they
always ask me this question.
00:56:07: I feel like I'm
missing something.
00:56:10: I don't feel like
I'm missing shit.
00:56:13: I don't have what you all have.
00:56:15: But you will never in
my life hear me tell you
00:56:20: I'm missing something.
00:56:21: And everybody is.
00:56:23: They're missing this feeling.
00:56:26: I found it a long time ago.
00:56:29: And I found it right there
in that willpower thing.
00:56:32: When you're nothing,
nothing, and change yourself
00:56:36: into something, like me, you
call it happiness, peace,
00:56:43: whatever the fuck
you want to call it,
00:56:47: people are missing exactly what
went on with David Goggins.
00:56:51: Why don't you smile?
00:56:52: I do.
00:56:53: I do.
00:56:54: But I figured something out.
00:56:56: That's why I am never--
00:56:58: you never hear me say,
I'm missing something.
00:57:00: I found it years ago.
00:57:02: You find it in the suck.
00:57:06: You find it in the suck.
00:57:07: And you find it repeatedly
in the suck to the point
00:57:10: where you know
exactly who you are.
00:57:12: Most people are
missing something
00:57:13: because they don't
know who they are.
00:57:17: They never examined themselves.
00:57:19: They've never done this
experiment on themselves.
00:57:23: The lab rat.
00:57:24: We're all lab rats.
00:57:25: But you're also the scientist.
00:57:28: You create your own self.
00:57:30: Most people are
missing something
00:57:32: because there's so
much trapped in there.
00:57:35: I don't even want
to say potential.
00:57:37: I think that's a word--
it's used out too much too.
00:57:39: There's so much in you that
God or whoever the hell
00:57:42: you believe in or if
you're an atheist in you
00:57:44: that you have not unlocked,
that you walk around
00:57:48: with this gorgeous wife or great
husband and all this money.
00:57:51: You're like, god, I feel
like I'm missing something.
00:57:54: Yeah, because it's
about 75% of you
00:57:58: is still fucking in there, still
chained up because you just
00:58:03: didn't want to find
your willpower,
00:58:05: didn't want to find your
soul, your will, your heart,
00:58:07: your determination,
your guts, your courage.
00:58:10: And what that looks
like, it looks scary,
00:58:12: like you're little
scary lab that went in.
00:58:14: Scary to wake up every
day and say, I'm stupid,
00:58:18: but I'm going to
figure out a way
00:58:19: to be smarter versus saying,
man, I just can't do that.
00:58:24: So you limit this box.
00:58:25: So your box becomes so
small of things you can do.
00:58:29: My box wasn't even a box.
00:58:31: It was a fucking little pinhole.
00:58:35: And then through
examining myself,
00:58:38: getting some willpower,
some courage,
00:58:41: it became bigger
than this table.
00:58:42: But that's what we all do.
00:58:43: That's why I wanted to
come here today and talk
00:58:45: to you about real shit,
not no fucking hacks.
00:58:48: There's no hacks, bro.
00:58:50: It's you against you.
00:58:52: You against you.
00:58:54: And if you
misunderstand that, you
00:58:56: have a real problem,
real problem.
00:58:59: I can understand
you misunderstand
00:59:00: me, running down the street,
shirt off, fuck this, no.
00:59:03: Yeah.
00:59:04: I can get it.
00:59:04: I get it.
00:59:05: If you misunderstand what
I'm saying right now today,
00:59:09: the problem is you.
00:59:11: And you don't want to fix it.
00:59:13: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the
children of wealthy people
00:59:15: are a case study in how
not having enough friction
00:59:20: can destroy a life.
00:59:21: DAVID GOGGINS: True statement.
00:59:23: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
mean, I could list off
00:59:24: prominent names in the press.
00:59:26: But those are actually
the least interesting.
00:59:28: What's probably more
interesting, as an example,
00:59:30: is all the ones we don't
hear about because we never
00:59:33: hear about them.
00:59:34: They just dwindle and wither.
00:59:36: Or I think there's this
big category of people,
00:59:39: I'm realizing, as we have this
conversation today that they're
00:59:44: not super successful.
00:59:45: They're not struggling.
00:59:48: They're successful enough
that they never have to--
00:59:52: you can get to the
point where you
00:59:54: don't have to impose friction.
00:59:56: You even said it.
00:59:57: Your bank account is in a
place where you don't really
00:59:59: need to do all
the things you do,
01:00:01: probably not even a
small fraction of them.
01:00:02: DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing.
01:00:03: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
01:00:04: But you realize the
stick and being haunted
01:00:06: is the fuel and the engine.
01:00:09: And you'd be a-- you'd be
truly crazy to give that up
01:00:13: because you've
internalized all that.
01:00:15: But most people, they're
good enough for them.
01:00:19: And so they don't actually
want to be better badly enough
01:00:23: in order to start
going rung after rung.
01:00:28: DAVID GOGGINS: Well, think
about when you build willpower.
01:00:30: And think about how
much I've built.
01:00:33: Now that you know about this--
01:00:35: I didn't know about this.
01:00:36: But think about how
much I've built.
01:00:38: Everything I've ever done in
my life, I didn't want to do.
01:00:42: Everything every day.
01:00:44: I'm a lazy piece of shit.
01:00:48: And I'm one of the hardest
working people to ever step
01:00:50: foot on this planet Earth.
01:00:51: And I'm saying that very proudly
because I know what I do.
01:00:54: It's not cocky.
01:00:55: I'll tell you I'm stupid.
01:00:57: And I'll also tell you the exact
opposite of what I've done.
01:01:01: It's the truth.
01:01:03: It is the truth.
01:01:04: So imagine how much I've
developed in that time frame.
01:01:07: But this is the scary thing.
01:01:10: Why most people don't want to
do that and build that willpower
01:01:15: is because it is scary.
01:01:18: It unlocks a whole bunch
of things about who you are
01:01:20: and who you're not.
01:01:22: And a lot of people don't
want to go down that journey
01:01:24: to discover who they
are and who they're not
01:01:27: because it's not
a pretty journey.
01:01:30: I mean, I've gone down it.
01:01:31: It's not like I
went down it once.
01:01:34: I go down it all the time.
01:01:36: And when you unlock that-- and
you can't just turn it off.
01:01:39: Like, people say, hey, how
come you haven't retired yet?
01:01:43: I built all this willpower.
01:01:47: Do you think it's
going to let me just
01:01:50: retire because my knees hurt?
01:01:53: It is telling me every morning--
01:01:55: I wake up, and I'm like,
man, my knees hurt.
01:01:58: My legs hurt.
01:01:58: My body hurts.
01:01:59: But you can still run.
01:02:01: So why aren't you running?
01:02:04: If you can still run--
01:02:05: there will be a time when you
can't lace them up anymore.
01:02:07: But you can still run.
01:02:10: So I still run.
01:02:12: When the time comes I can't
run, the body will say,
01:02:16: you just can't run.
01:02:17: But if I can still
do something, that
01:02:20: willpower that I
have created, it
01:02:23: makes me do it
every fucking day.
01:02:26: And that's what they don't get.
01:02:27: What builds a human being is you
start with the small building
01:02:31: blocks.
01:02:32: And before you know it,
man, you become something
01:02:34: that it doesn't even
make sense to most people
01:02:36: because it's just
who you are now.
01:02:38: That's why I can still
run at 50 with broke--
01:02:41: at 49 with broke down
knees and broke down body
01:02:43: because my body
knows you still can.
01:02:46: Therefore, I do.
01:02:47: Second you stop, the
willpower is gone.
01:02:50: And that's beautiful.
01:02:51: I'm so glad you brought that to
me because I always wondered,
01:02:55: what's this
separation thing now?
01:02:58: At 24 years old, I
started building something
01:03:00: that I didn't even
know was going
01:03:01: to be what it is now at 49.
01:03:03: And that's all it was.
01:03:05: It was just that.
01:03:07: ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,
anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
01:03:10: has inputs and outputs
from a bunch of places.
01:03:12: But you'll probably not
be surprised to learn
01:03:15: that it's strongly activated
when we move our body when
01:03:20: we don't want to move our body.
01:03:23: I feel like it's like the
David Goggins structure.
01:03:25: DAVID GOGGINS: It really is.
01:03:27: ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.
01:03:28: And it also has
strong connections
01:03:30: to the dopamine reward pathway.
01:03:31: And everyone goes,
yay, dopamine.
01:03:33: Everyone loves dopamine.
01:03:34: I'm partially responsible
for people knowing a bit more
01:03:38: about dopamine.
01:03:39: But dopamine's badly understood.
01:03:41: Everyone thinks
dopamine, dopamine hits.
01:03:43: It's about reward.
01:03:44: It's about motivation and drive.
01:03:47: And there are pain inputs to the
dopamine centers of the brain.
01:03:51: No one talks about that.
01:03:52: Everyone's like, oh, you want
the chocolate, chocolate, sex,
01:03:55: cocaine.
01:03:56: Yeah, that's all true.
01:03:57: It'll release dopamine.
01:03:59: Pain releases dopamine.
01:04:00: The anterior
mid-cingulate cortex
01:04:02: can trigger the release
of dopamine in response
01:04:05: to this thing that
we're calling friction.
01:04:07: And that's a learned thing.
01:04:10: That's something that
no animal or human being
01:04:12: comes into the world learning.
01:04:13: We all are averse to pain.
01:04:16: And like pleasure,
like sugar, fat.
01:04:19: Don't like hot surfaces.
01:04:21: But this is a
structure that learns.
01:04:25: It has neuroplasticity,
the ability
01:04:27: to change throughout
the entire life span.
01:04:29: And here's the
part that I think,
01:04:31: again, is just neuro nerd
speak for what you already know
01:04:34: and have done and exemplify,
is that people say,
01:04:38: oh, it has plasticity.
01:04:39: You can change it.
01:04:40: But guess what?
01:04:40: It has plasticity
in both directions.
01:04:42: It can grow.
01:04:43: But just as easily as it can
grow, it's like Silly Putty,
01:04:46: it can shrink.
01:04:47: So it requires constant upkeep.
01:04:51: And that answer isn't one
that people are going to like.
01:04:54: They're like, give
me the energy drink.
01:04:56: Give me the supplement.
01:04:57: Give me the-- give me
the sauna protocol that's
01:04:59: going to make my anterior
mid-cingulate cortex-- there's
01:05:02: someone out there
right now who's going,
01:05:03: wait, if I took transcranial
magnetic stimulation
01:05:05: and I stimulate-- yeah, you'd
probably-- actually, they've
01:05:08: done that.
01:05:08: They stuck a little
wire during neurosurgery
01:05:10: into this structure.
01:05:12: This was actually
discovered by a colleague
01:05:14: of mine, Joe Parvizi.
01:05:17: Stimulate.
01:05:17: And the patients go, I feel
like there's a storm coming.
01:05:21: And they go, oh, is it scary?
01:05:23: And they go, no, I
want to go through it.
01:05:25: They come off the stimulation,
and people are like--
01:05:28: this is the seat of what
we're talking about.
01:05:30: DAVID GOGGINS: Right.
01:05:31: Exactly.
01:05:32: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns.
01:05:33: So the fact that you've
kept this brain structure--
01:05:36: I'm convinced if we imaged
your brain, it'd be large,
01:05:40: and it would be larger
in two years, in a year.
01:05:44: But this is the no days off
rationale because it can grow,
01:05:48: and it can shrink.
01:05:49: DAVID GOGGINS: I know.
01:05:50: What you're saying right now,
I didn't know any of this.
01:05:54: And I never-- and I
always talk to you.
01:05:55: But I wish I could
just put this on paper.
01:05:59: And you're saying it in a way
that people can understand.
01:06:02: I can never put it into
words on what I built
01:06:06: and the power that
is within all of us.
01:06:10: But you put it so
in a scientific way.
01:06:14: Most people, for
me, he's just crazy.
01:06:16: That's why I don't like
talking about it, man.
01:06:19: I know I'm not crazy.
01:06:21: I know what I had to do
to get where I had to go.
01:06:24: People look at it as crazy
because there are people
01:06:26: that just--
01:06:27: if you can't imagine
yourself doing something,
01:06:31: if you can't imagine
yourself doing something,
01:06:33: the person that's
doing it is crazy
01:06:36: because in your mind, the logic
behind it, it doesn't compute.
01:06:41: Therefore, you have to
give somebody a title.
01:06:44: And the title for me
is usually he's crazy
01:06:47: or he's this, he's that.
01:06:48: No.
01:06:49: No.
01:06:51: For some reason, me
wanting to be somebody
01:06:53: so fucking bad in my
life, I created that.
01:06:57: And I've been
trying to figure out
01:06:59: years of my life trying
to explain to people.
01:07:02: But even though you're
explaining it now,
01:07:06: this is the easy fucking part.
01:07:09: Them listening to this shit
is the easy fucking part.
01:07:13: The part that why they're
always be the ones of ones
01:07:18: is because putting
that practice,
01:07:22: putting that into
actual work, no, man.
01:07:26: No.
01:07:27: No.
01:07:27: That's where the demons come in.
01:07:29: That's where you're like,
I don't want to be better.
01:07:33: I don't want to be better.
01:07:34: If this is what it
takes to be better,
01:07:35: I don't want to be better.
01:07:36: So everybody's-- that's why
there's a lot of average.
01:07:40: And it makes me so fucking mad.
01:07:43: Every day I walk this
Earth, and I see average
01:07:46: all over the fucking place.
01:07:48: And they want to ask
me, how did you do it?
01:07:51: I can't tell you how because
you're not going to fucking--
01:07:53: you're not going to do it.
01:07:55: You're not going to do it you.
01:07:56: You're just going to--
01:07:57: You're going to continue
being like this every day
01:07:58: you wake up.
01:07:59: Like you said, it's
like, get the coffee.
01:08:03: Make the pancakes.
01:08:05: Kiss the girl.
01:08:06: Kiss the kids.
01:08:08: You wake up, right to work.
01:08:10: Immediate, your
mind is in action.
01:08:13: No one wants to do that.
01:08:15: No one.
01:08:15: And I don't blame them.
01:08:17: But don't be mad when
you're laying there
01:08:19: in your fucking bed, and
you're in the fucking hospital,
01:08:22: and you're 70, 80, 90 years old.
01:08:24: And you're thinking,
man, I feel like I
01:08:27: didn't fucking do something.
01:08:29: Because you did.
01:08:30: You didn't do it.
01:08:31: You didn't do shit.
01:08:33: You may have lived
a great life, man,
01:08:35: but you're always going
to feel empty inside.
01:08:37: I don't feel empty.
01:08:38: So call me what you want.
01:08:39: There's not one empty
bone in my fucking body
01:08:44: because I have figured
out that really--
01:08:47: the magic potion,
at least to my life.
01:08:50: And it's very rewarding.
01:08:52: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a quick break
01:08:54: and thank our sponsor,
InsideTracker.
01:08:56: InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
01:08:59: that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
01:09:01: to help me better
understand your body
01:09:03: and help you reach
your health goals.
01:09:05: I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
01:09:07: for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
01:09:10: your immediate and
long-term health
01:09:11: can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
01:09:14: Now, a major problem
with a lot of blood
01:09:16: tests out there, however,
is that you get information
01:09:19: back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones
01:09:21: and so forth.
01:09:22: But you don't know what to
do with that information
01:09:24: With InsideTracker,
they make it very easy,
01:09:26: because they have a
personalized platform, that
01:09:28: allows you to see
the levels of all
01:09:30: those things, metabolic factors,
lipids, hormones, et cetera.
01:09:33: But it gives you
specific directives
01:09:35: that you can follow that
relate to nutrition,
01:09:37: behavioral modification,
supplements,
01:09:39: et cetera that
can help you bring
01:09:40: those numbers into the ranges
that are optimal for you.
01:09:43: If you'd like to
try InsideTracker,
01:09:45: you can go to
insidetracker.com/huberman
01:09:48: to get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.
01:09:51: Again, that's
insidetracker.com/huberman.
01:09:55: People like to talk about what
they used to be able to do.
01:09:58: I hear this a lot.
01:09:59: You should have seen
me in high school.
01:10:01: I always laugh.
01:10:02: Like, yeah, OK.
01:10:03: Got it.
01:10:04: And it's not just guys.
01:10:05: You should have seen me
working out in high school.
01:10:08: I was super fit.
01:10:09: People will look
back to a time where
01:10:11: they felt like they were
capable of something.
01:10:14: And now they're not.
01:10:15: And you kind of want to
just grab them and go, wait.
01:10:18: That was you then.
01:10:18: It's you now.
01:10:19: And but people tend
to think about how
01:10:21: the conditions that
were around success
01:10:25: must have been part of it.
01:10:27: And you can understand why.
01:10:28: It's very rational.
01:10:30: I was in that situation.
01:10:31: I was successful.
01:10:32: I'm in this situation.
01:10:33: I'm not.
01:10:34: That was the past.
01:10:35: This is the present.
01:10:37: Ergo, capable.
01:10:39: You see how people
get into these loops.
01:10:41: And as you mentioned, you spent
the first 20 years of your life
01:10:43: in extremely challenged
circumstances.
01:10:46: And then you can see how
people get to a point
01:10:48: where everything feels hard.
01:10:52: Like, when you're 300 pounds--
01:10:53: I haven't ever been 300 pounds.
01:10:55: But I can't imagine it feels
good to get up and move around.
01:10:59: DAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating.
01:11:00: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend.
01:11:01: He's in excess of 300 pounds.
01:11:04: We've been trying
on him for years.
01:11:05: But no win.
01:11:07: And he's got crazy psoriasis
on the back of his calves.
01:11:10: And he actually
smells bad sometimes
01:11:13: because he can't wash
as well as he would.
01:11:15: He's big, big.
01:11:17: And it pulls all my sympathy.
01:11:20: But life is very hard for
him and getting worse.
01:11:23: He's a young guy with
a lot of medical issues
01:11:25: now, for obvious reasons.
01:11:27: And so I think people like that
think, well, it's already hard.
01:11:31: Why would I make it harder?
01:11:34: Your message is a
little different.
01:11:36: And you have the
life experience.
01:11:38: DAVID GOGGINS: It's
a lot different.
01:11:38: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You've been there.
01:11:40: So for me, saying, oh
yeah, lose weight--
01:11:44: I was a skinny guy who got
to be a less skinny guy.
01:11:47: So I don't really have
a foot to stand on.
01:11:53: What do you say to those
people who are like,
01:11:55: listen, getting up in
the morning is hard.
01:11:58: Trying to not dissolve into
a puddle of my own tears
01:12:00: and my own misery is hard.
01:12:03: DAVID GOGGINS: You know why
people connect with my books
01:12:06: so well?
01:12:06: For some reason, God put me
in almost every fucked up
01:12:09: situation on the planet Earth.
01:12:11: So when I talk to people,
it's not sugar-coated
01:12:14: because I'm not saying it from I
was a 175 pounds my whole life.
01:12:21: I don't say much
to those people.
01:12:24: Maybe you're a piece of shit.
01:12:27: Maybe you want to be nobody.
01:12:29: Maybe you're happy exactly
where you are in life
01:12:31: because obviously, you are.
01:12:33: Maybe you don't have
the determination
01:12:35: to be somebody better
than who you are.
01:12:37: And if you want to live with
that, I'll support you in that.
01:12:42: If you're good with being who
you are, that every day you
01:12:46: wake up, and every day, you
smell like shit because you
01:12:48: can't wash your body well,
and your skin is messed up
01:12:51: because your health's
so bad, and you
01:12:53: can't put your clothes on
right, you need help with that.
01:12:54: You need help like--
when I was 300 pounds,
01:12:56: I needed help wiping my ass.
01:12:59: That makes you feel good?
01:13:02: Nothing I can say to you.
01:13:04: If every day you wake up with
this-- see, people are haunted.
01:13:08: But they obviously
like horror films
01:13:10: because they keep watching
the same fucking movie.
01:13:13: I don't like horror films.
01:13:14: A lot of people
like horror films.
01:13:16: So I don't say much to them.
01:13:18: I say exactly what I
said to you right there
01:13:21: because I was once you.
01:13:24: I didn't like horror
films, so I changed it.
01:13:26: Some people are just--
01:13:28: they become-- like you
said, it gets real small
01:13:31: when you're lazy and
you're fat, your will.
01:13:35: Their will is so small
that they don't have any.
01:13:39: And you can't give it to them.
01:13:41: There has to be
something-- this is
01:13:42: what I'm talking about now
because this isn't a hack.
01:13:47: This has to be in you.
01:13:49: Something in you has to wake up.
01:13:53: And usually, the only person
that can wake it up is you.
01:13:56: Sometimes you can read
a David Goggins book
01:13:58: because I was all this shit and
then a lot more of fucked up.
01:14:03: But if you don't have a
little flame, just barely--
01:14:08: you're done.
01:14:10: I can't light it for you.
01:14:13: And that's the harsh
reality of this life
01:14:15: that I want to get
across so fucking bad.
01:14:18: You can watch me.
01:14:19: You can watch you.
01:14:20: You can watch fucking
Rogan and Cameron
01:14:22: Hanes, all these motherfuckers.
01:14:23: You can go to Tony
Robbins's fucking bullshit,
01:14:26: all this shit.
01:14:27: You can do all this shit.
01:14:30: You're going to keep
going back and keep
01:14:32: spending money and
spending money and spending
01:14:35: money with no results.
01:14:36: You're going to wonder, wow.
01:14:37: Maybe let me go try
out David Goggins.
01:14:39: He ain't going to
fucking help you.
01:14:42: You have to explore, examine
the insides of yourself.
01:14:47: And what do you really
want out of life?
01:14:49: Your friend and a lot
of people out here
01:14:52: just don't fucking want it.
01:14:54: So guess what?
01:14:56: Have fun with your life.
01:14:58: Go from 300 to 350
to 400 to 450 to 500
01:15:03: because you don't want it.
01:15:07: And that's the harsh reality.
01:15:09: I can't give you shit.
01:15:11: You can't give them shit.
01:15:12: We can give you ideas.
01:15:14: But end of the day, when
I was losing the weight,
01:15:18: I had to miserably wake up
every morning in the cold
01:15:22: because it was Indiana,
November, when it started.
01:15:25: I was miserable.
01:15:28: This is your new life.
01:15:31: Take it or leave it.
01:15:33: There's no happiness about it.
01:15:35: There's no peace behind it.
01:15:37: It sucks.
01:15:38: It just fucking sucks.
01:15:41: And that's the one thing, if I
could teach anybody anything,
01:15:46: it just fucking sucks.
01:15:48: And it's going to
continue to suck.
01:15:51: And then one day, you'll get
to a special part in your life
01:15:54: that it might get a
little bit better.
01:15:56: But to lose the weight you
have to lose, my friend, sorry.
01:16:02: It's going to suck every
fucking day because then when
01:16:05: you're 300 pounds, you're
going to go out to lose weight,
01:16:07: you could probably get injured.
01:16:09: So then you got to
work on the injury.
01:16:11: And then you get
even more depressed.
01:16:12: This is what I went through.
01:16:13: And then you're hungry
because now you're depressed.
01:16:16: It's just a vicious cycle.
01:16:18: And if you're not
strong mentally
01:16:21: and you have no
willpower, you're
01:16:23: going to continue
falling back in this hole
01:16:25: versus the man that
sits back and goes,
01:16:27: all right, motherfucker.
01:16:28: This is why I cuss because
this is what is in me.
01:16:31: This is what it took
for me to be me.
01:16:34: Sorry.
01:16:35: It didn't take, hey, OK,
we're going to do this today.
01:16:37: No.
01:16:37: This fucking really sucks.
01:16:39: This is real, dude.
01:16:41: This is real.
01:16:43: And every day, I'm set back.
01:16:46: I'm set back.
01:16:46: I'm set back.
01:16:47: I'm set back.
01:16:48: So this is what I
would tell your boy.
01:16:50: This is exactly
what I'd tell him.
01:16:51: Every day you wake up,
you're going to probably
01:16:53: be set back for the
first four weeks
01:16:55: before you lose significant
weight because the mind is
01:16:58: going to be fucking
with you the whole time.
01:17:00: There's no dopamine.
01:17:02: There's no dopamine in
there at 300 pounds.
01:17:05: You got nothing.
01:17:06: Your hormones are shot.
01:17:08: You have to envision something
that is more powerful than you.
01:17:13: Something has to
get you out of bed.
01:17:17: And you have to create it.
01:17:18: It has to be false
because you're not it.
01:17:21: You're a fat piece of shit.
01:17:23: And that's the reality of it.
01:17:25: So you have to create a false
reality, to live in that
01:17:30: just to get to work on yourself.
01:17:35: That's the reality.
01:17:36: ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'll
see this, and he'll
01:17:38: appreciate that message.
01:17:39: We'll see what he does.
01:17:40: DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see.
01:17:41: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last
13 years, it's been no movement.
01:17:44: But I have had other
friends who were
01:17:48: drug and alcohol addicts who
quit after one conversation.
01:17:52: Never went back.
01:17:53: DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome.
01:17:54: That means they want it.
01:17:55: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just
one guy, I won't out him,
01:17:58: but walked up to me at a
party in 2019, July 4th party,
01:18:01: and said, I'm a pile.
01:18:04: And I go, what?
01:18:05: And he goes, I'm a pile.
01:18:05: Look at me.
01:18:06: I'm 60 pounds overweight.
01:18:07: And I go, do you drink?
01:18:08: He goes, every day.
01:18:08: I go, how much?
01:18:09: He goes, a case.
01:18:11: He goes, I smoke a lot of weed.
01:18:12: But he's successful in
other areas of his life.
01:18:15: And so I said, well,
here's what I know.
01:18:18: Quit alcohol and weed for you.
01:18:20: I'm not telling
people what to do.
01:18:22: Don't eat until 2:00 PM.
01:18:24: Get on an exercise
bike, and pedal
01:18:27: in the morning like someone's
chasing you with a poison dart
01:18:31: until you want to puke.
01:18:33: And I was kind of half-joking.
01:18:35: And then two months
later, he was, like,
01:18:39: I haven't had a drink.
01:18:40: I lost 30 pounds.
01:18:41: He lost those 60 pounds.
01:18:42: He never went back.
01:18:42: Now, he's super fit.
01:18:44: It's amazing.
01:18:45: So some people flip the switch.
01:18:47: He is very
self-critical by nature.
01:18:50: DAVID GOGGINS:
That's what flips--
01:18:51: ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's
super self-critical.
01:18:53: DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.
01:18:53: That's what flips the switch.
01:18:55: Think about it, man.
01:18:57: We know what to do.
01:18:59: We don't need Andrew Huberman
to tell us what to do.
01:19:02: We know what to do,
every one of us.
01:19:05: That's why he flipped it so
fast because he knew what to do.
01:19:10: He didn't go by
your exact protocol.
01:19:13: He didn't go by the exact--
01:19:15: no.
01:19:15: He knew exactly what to do.
01:19:19: And you just saying some shit
to him, it woke something up.
01:19:24: He knew what to do.
01:19:25: And that's the thing that
people need to get that.
01:19:28: You know what to do.
01:19:29: Why aren't you doing it?
01:19:31: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm
talking about myself now.
01:19:34: Those modes of just kind
of passive consumption,
01:19:37: they're so easy to wash over us.
01:19:39: I used to have this thing,
and I'm fighting this
01:19:41: now because I knew we were
going to have this conversation
01:19:43: today, where I like
to start things
01:19:44: on the hour or the half hour.
01:19:46: Worst practice in
the world for me
01:19:50: because if I miss that half
hour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33.
01:19:55: I'll start at 12:45.
01:19:58: Ah, it's 12:45.
01:20:00: I'll start at 1:00.
01:20:01: I just lost time.
01:20:03: And so this is so stupid.
01:20:05: And the other day,
I was like, man, I
01:20:07: got to tell David about this
because my new thing is I start
01:20:10: no matter what time it is.
01:20:12: If I wake up in the
middle of the night--
01:20:13: I got a friend.
01:20:14: He paints in the
middle of the night.
01:20:15: I'm like, you're an insomniac?
01:20:16: He's like, I don't know.
01:20:17: I just do it.
01:20:18: Then sometimes he
goes back to sleep.
01:20:19: Sometimes he doesn't.
01:20:20: Everyone's got their thing.
01:20:21: But I thought about this.
01:20:22: I'm like, no more am I
going to say I'm starting
01:20:24: at 1:00 because I know me.
01:20:26: If I miss the 1:00 ding and then
my pen's not hitting the paper
01:20:30: or I'm not typing
on the keyboard,
01:20:32: I'm not going to do it.
01:20:33: But That's a
self-admitted weakness.
01:20:36: DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man.
01:20:37: I had that for a lot of years.
01:20:40: I know I'm going to do it.
01:20:43: That's the haunting part is
that it's going to happen.
01:20:48: It has to happen.
01:20:51: And that's a fact.
01:20:52: Like, there's no get out
of jail free card, bro.
01:20:55: None.
01:20:56: Like, that is a life
that I don't know.
01:21:00: I don't have that ability.
01:21:03: Or I have the ability.
01:21:04: I don't have the--
01:21:07: I'm not good enough,
smart enough.
01:21:11: I'm not talented
enough to do that.
01:21:16: Some people are.
01:21:18: Some people can start at 1:00.
01:21:19: Some people don't
have to start at all.
01:21:22: If you lack talent, you
can't sit back and say,
01:21:27: I'll start in half an hour.
01:21:30: I can't do that.
01:21:31: I got to start now.
01:21:32: And after I get back from
starting, I got to start again.
01:21:35: And then when I get done with
that run or that study session,
01:21:38: if it wasn't good enough,
I got to go back again
01:21:41: because repetition is
what taught me everything.
01:21:45: So you can honestly
outwork anything.
01:21:48: But it's that you, obviously,
are a very talented man.
01:21:53: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have
worked hard at certain things
01:21:56: and built up some
things that I've
01:21:59: been good at most of my life.
01:22:00: DAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing.
01:22:01: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,
organizing, and disseminating
01:22:03: information's
something I've been
01:22:04: doing since I was a little kid.
01:22:05: I used to give lectures at
school on Monday about stuff
01:22:08: I learned over the weekend.
01:22:09: DAVID GOGGINS: See,
check that out.
01:22:10: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But they
took me to a psychiatrist.
01:22:12: We're the same age.
01:22:13: Back then, if you got
sent to a psychiatrist,
01:22:14: people thought you were crazy.
01:22:16: DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.
01:22:16: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly.
01:22:17: DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.
01:22:18: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.
01:22:19: So I remember
feeling like a freak.
01:22:20: Also, I didn't have a stutter,
but I had a grunting tic.
01:22:23: It comes back when I'm tired.
01:22:24: And the only thing that
helped that was hitting
01:22:27: my head on something,
shaking my head,
01:22:31: which is why skateboarding
was good because I'd slam,
01:22:33: and I'd feel like, oh.
01:22:34: I feel good.
01:22:35: But that's not healthy.
01:22:37: That's not good.
01:22:38: Or just work.
01:22:39: Work is what gets it out.
01:22:40: It's like an-- it's
like an RPM or high.
01:22:42: [REVVING SOUND]
Anyway, that's me.
01:22:45: But yeah, I think
certain things over time,
01:22:47: I feel like talent or gifts or
whatever you want to call them,
01:22:50: but there are many
things that are
01:22:51: exceedingly difficult for me.
01:22:54: And I have learned
from your example.
01:22:55: I know that you are very
both humble and very clear
01:22:59: that you don't have--
you say, you're
01:23:01: not going to get it
by examining you.
01:23:03: But I think the way
you're sharing today
01:23:06: and the way you've shared
it on other podcasts before,
01:23:09: there are pieces
that really help
01:23:11: people feel into
the process of what
01:23:15: you're talking about today.
01:23:16: We're elaborating on it, I
think, a lot, this notion
01:23:19: of being haunted and the stick.
01:23:21: I mean, of course, of course,
now it makes so much sense why
01:23:25: you don't want to talk about
sleep or rest or recovery
01:23:27: because that's--
01:23:28: sure, that's important.
01:23:30: I've heard you say,
yes, you sleep.
01:23:31: Yes, you eat.
01:23:32: Yes, you hydrate.
01:23:33: Yes, you will stretch
your psoas or whatever.
01:23:35: But it's funny how that
becomes the viral message.
01:23:37: DAVID GOGGINS: That's why
I said fuck that today.
01:23:38: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
that's not the unique--
01:23:40: that's not the unique
message that you carry.
01:23:44: Like, anyone can
talk about that.
01:23:46: So do I have that right?
01:23:47: That you're acknowledging
sleep is important.
01:23:49: Recovery is important.
01:23:50: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
01:23:50: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's
not what you're about.
01:23:52: DAVID GOGGINS: You have
to forego something.
01:23:54: Yes.
01:23:55: Ice baths.
01:23:57: Saunas.
01:23:58: Sleep.
01:23:59: Nutrition.
01:24:00: All this shit's so
fucking important, dude.
01:24:03: I don't have time
for some of it.
01:24:06: To extract what I had to
extract, something had to give.
01:24:10: Like, you talk about you
when you were younger.
01:24:12: You would give these
speeches and stuff.
01:24:15: The same age you
were giving speeches,
01:24:17: I was trying to figure out how
to say the without stuttering.
01:24:21: And I realized, as I got older,
that all these things are
01:24:24: important.
01:24:26: But for me to stop
stuttering, I got
01:24:28: to build fucking confidence.
01:24:32: And speech therapy
didn't help that.
01:24:34: Nothing helped that.
01:24:36: I have to forgo a lot of
shit to be as fucked up
01:24:40: as I am to build
confidence, for me
01:24:43: to stand in a fucking room of
10,000-- of one person, and not
01:24:46: [STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be
like, oh, and put my head down.
01:24:49: Let me look around.
01:24:51: Let me read these
paragraphs first.
01:24:54: And then before I
read the paragraphs,
01:24:56: because they're
calling me next, let
01:24:57: me just leave the room
because I'm going to stutter.
01:25:00: That's a miserable life.
01:25:02: And that's one of many
things I did besides lying,
01:25:05: besides being insecure,
besides being immature,
01:25:07: besides being fat, besides
being one of the only Black kids
01:25:11: in my school.
01:25:11: There's a lot of things I had
to overcome to gain confidence.
01:25:16: And in doing so, a
lot of that had to go.
01:25:20: A lot of it.
01:25:21: So I became the guy that became,
once again, misunderstood.
01:25:24: You only sleep four hours
a day, two hours a day?
01:25:26: Sometimes you
don't sleep at all?
01:25:28: Like, what's this, and
what's this, and what's this?
01:25:31: I know it's all important.
01:25:35: I can't.
01:25:35: Something's got to go.
01:25:36: For me to get confidence,
because confidence
01:25:39: is the building block of
where I'm trying to go,
01:25:41: for me to gain
confidence in myself,
01:25:44: this fucked up kid has got
to do a lot of fucked up shit
01:25:46: to gain confidence.
01:25:48: And along the way,
the stutter went away.
01:25:51: And I gained confidence.
01:25:52: And now, my life is
a little bit more--
01:25:56: there is no balance.
01:25:59: There is no balance.
01:26:01: It's a little bit more what it
should be for a lot of people.
01:26:05: But there'll never be balance
because confidence is something
01:26:07: that you're constantly--
01:26:09: confidence and belief
you're building every day.
01:26:13: And so something's got to give.
01:26:15: And I'm willing to
forego a lot of things
01:26:17: to have that because
I know if you
01:26:20: want to give
somebody kryptonite,
01:26:23: take that shit away from them.
01:26:25: So yeah, I don't
sleep sometimes.
01:26:27: And sometimes I don't
eat the right way.
01:26:29: And sometimes I don't do this
and do that and whatever, man.
01:26:31: But you put me in a room
of 10,000 people any time
01:26:34: of the day, and I'll
walk in there thinking
01:26:36: I'm the baddest
motherfucker in here
01:26:38: because I know what it
took to be on this stage.
01:26:40: And a lot of people
would not do that.
01:26:42: So that's what it takes.
01:26:44: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's a question
01:26:46: I've been wanting to ask
you since we started.
01:26:48: And I thought about
coming in here.
01:26:50: And I've been thinking about
in the weeks ahead of this.
01:26:52: And I'm going to just come
clean and say I don't exactly
01:26:54: know how to ask the question.
01:26:56: DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it.
01:26:58: ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
about relationships.
01:26:59: DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man.
01:27:01: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So I know in myself
01:27:05: that my discipline is much
higher when it's just me.
01:27:09: But that's because I had
certain things early on.
01:27:12: But then I was a
terrible student.
01:27:14: Barely finished high school.
01:27:15: But then when I got
serious, I got serious.
01:27:16: But I did that by staying
away from everybody.
01:27:20: And anyone's who's ever had
a relationship of any kind,
01:27:25: but in particular,
romantic relationships,
01:27:27: knows that, yes, you can derive
tremendous support from those.
01:27:30: Like, you got this, baby.
01:27:31: You can go.
01:27:32: And you're like, yeah.
01:27:33: I got this.
01:27:34: She said I got this.
01:27:35: Feels great to finish something
and share with someone,
01:27:38: share a meal, get the hug.
01:27:40: But there's another
side to all of that
01:27:43: that I'd like to learn
more about from you,
01:27:45: which is there's a
warm body next to you
01:27:48: in bed in the morning.
01:27:49: You don't want to get up.
01:27:50: They also have needs.
01:27:52: You've got your mission
that people sometimes
01:27:56: need things from us.
01:27:58: But also, oftentimes,
the people that
01:28:00: love us most, that truly love
us and that want to support us,
01:28:04: don't understand this thing.
01:28:07: And they're the first people
to tell us, like, listen.
01:28:12: Take a day off.
01:28:13: And then this whole cycle,
at least in my head,
01:28:15: goes off, like, you
just want a vacation.
01:28:17: And then it's almost
like a paranoia.
01:28:19: I'm not saying anything
nice about myself right now.
01:28:21: DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man.
01:28:22: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Former girlfriends
01:28:23: are going to be like, yeah.
01:28:24: Like, they remember that.
01:28:25: And so support of people
close to you is critical.
01:28:29: This could be friends.
01:28:30: Could be romantic partners.
01:28:31: Whatever.
01:28:31: But they're also-- the
knife cuts both ways.
01:28:35: It can be the thing
that can really
01:28:37: undermine this thing that you're
talking about because people
01:28:40: that care about us also
want to see us comfortable.
01:28:42: They want to see us happy.
01:28:43: They want to see us peaceful.
01:28:45: They want to see us wake up
from a great night's sleep.
01:28:47: And they want things too.
01:28:49: So how do you untangle
that whole bit?
01:28:51: DAVID GOGGINS: Well,
it's funny, man.
01:28:53: I'm unbalanced, but
I'm mostly unbalanced
01:28:55: towards the family side, which
people don't get about me.
01:28:58: I'll start being unbalanced.
01:28:59: I get all my stuff in.
01:29:01: But what I do is I make sure
that my family has everything
01:29:04: they need, everything
they need, those who
01:29:08: want to be part of my family.
01:29:10: Some don't.
01:29:11: Some family members don't want
to be part of David Goggins.
01:29:14: I get it.
01:29:14: I got it.
01:29:15: That's life.
01:29:16: Those who are part
of my family, I
01:29:20: give them everything
they need so they
01:29:22: can leave me the fuck alone.
01:29:25: I make sure you're happy as fuck
because I got to go to work.
01:29:27: And I don't mean smokejumping.
01:29:30: I don't mean running.
01:29:32: I mean all of it.
01:29:34: It takes every--
01:29:35: I can't have you
in my fucking shit.
01:29:38: I can't.
01:29:39: So I know for me
to have a family,
01:29:42: I gotta make sure that you
realize I'm going to give you
01:29:44: everything you need.
01:29:44: So when you start
bitching at me,
01:29:46: I'm going to say, look, hang on.
01:29:48: I dedicated my life to give
you everything you need.
01:29:51: I need this time
right here for me
01:29:54: to be the best I can be
because this journey started
01:29:56: without anybody.
01:29:58: And I make sure everybody knows
that who comes in my life.
01:30:00: I've been left-- think about it.
01:30:03: I was left alone at a young
age to figure this shit out.
01:30:09: I figured it out for myself
and have been very successful
01:30:13: for myself.
01:30:14: No one's going to come in
here and fuck with my shit.
01:30:17: That's why I make sure I will
take care of whatever you need.
01:30:20: Whatever you need
from me, you got it.
01:30:22: Money, house, my
love, my support,
01:30:25: I'm going to give you
everything you need.
01:30:27: That said, I do it the
highest level possible.
01:30:31: And I'm saying that with
Jennifer in the next room.
01:30:33: So please come here
and say something
01:30:34: if it's wrong, Jennifer.
01:30:35: I don't give a fuck.
01:30:36: Say what you got to say.
01:30:37: So then when it's time
for me to go to work,
01:30:40: I expect you to
do the same for me
01:30:43: because it takes every bit of
me to do what I have to do.
01:30:48: So I make sure that I'm very
unbalanced from my family
01:30:52: so I can be exactly that
unbalanced for myself.
01:30:56: And that's how I do it.
01:30:58: I let people know
right up front,
01:31:00: I'm not what you want in a man.
01:31:06: I guarantee that.
01:31:07: There's going to be
a lot of late nights,
01:31:09: a lot of early
mornings, a lot of times
01:31:11: where I got to be by myself
thinking about the process that
01:31:14: is next in my mind.
01:31:16: I can't have aggravation.
01:31:17: I can't have this.
01:31:18: Can't have that.
01:31:18: There's a lot of things.
01:31:19: But I let them know up front.
01:31:21: I'm very vocal about that.
01:31:23: Sometimes relationships
work for me.
01:31:25: Sometimes they didn't.
01:31:27: But that's who I am.
01:31:28: One thing I did wrong in my life
was I tried for so many years
01:31:32: to please people.
01:31:35: And I did it at the
expense of myself.
01:31:40: I was leaving a lot in the tank.
01:31:42: And when you do that,
you stop living.
01:31:45: But the person in your
life is happy as fuck
01:31:48: because you're giving
them everything they want.
01:31:50: They have their--
their life is full.
01:31:53: But you feel empty.
01:31:55: And that's not a
relationship to me.
01:31:58: So for me, it's
important that you
01:32:00: know exactly who I am because
this is what life made.
01:32:05: And I'm not trying to change it
because I just figured it out.
01:32:10: So I'm not trying to
compromise David Goggins.
01:32:13: I would never, ever
compromise David Goggins.
01:32:17: That doesn't mean I won't
give you what you need
01:32:19: and what you want
and what you desire.
01:32:22: But I don't need money.
01:32:23: I don't need fame.
01:32:24: I don't need shit.
01:32:25: So I give it all away.
01:32:28: What I do need is to make sure
that that willpower is worked
01:32:33: on every fucking day and every
night for the rest of my life
01:32:36: because that's the
one thing that's
01:32:38: going to keep me feeding you,
keeping you where you need
01:32:41: to be, because once
that willpower is gone,
01:32:44: 300-pound David Goggins,
he may not look like it,
01:32:47: but I will walk around with it.
01:32:51: So the things that are
important to you in life,
01:32:53: you must do always.
01:32:55: Or you're nobody.
01:32:57: And that's how I
handle relationships.
01:33:00: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that.
01:33:01: Something I could
personally work on
01:33:03: is that upfront,
clear communication
01:33:06: because it resonates that
feeling of there's something
01:33:09: inside that's not getting worked
out that, when I'm on my own,
01:33:13: it's a lot easier.
01:33:14: But then, of course, wanting
relationships and family,
01:33:17: I think that's a healthy
part of being human too.
01:33:19: And obviously,
you've worked it out.
01:33:20: So I appreciate
you sharing that.
01:33:22: I don't think I've
ever heard you
01:33:23: talk about it that way before.
01:33:25: DAVID GOGGINS: People are
scared of that conversation
01:33:27: with their wife, husband,
girlfriend, boyfriend.
01:33:30: But why are you scared of it?
01:33:33: Why are you scared to tell
a motherfucker, your wife,
01:33:36: your husband, who you are, who
you are, exactly who you are?
01:33:42: And that was the problem
I had-- that's a problem
01:33:44: that a lot of us have in life.
01:33:46: No one knows who you really are.
01:33:49: No one knew who I really was.
01:33:52: I went to a school where there
were a lot of Black kids.
01:33:55: A lot of Black kids didn't
want to be in special ops.
01:33:58: I never talked about
special ops to Black kids.
01:34:01: Why?
01:34:03: I was wondering what--
01:34:04: I'm not going to fit in.
01:34:07: That's not what they do.
01:34:08: A lot of Black kids don't
do that kind of shit.
01:34:10: So whatever I wanted
to do, no one really
01:34:13: knew the real me growing up
because I never wanted anybody
01:34:16: to know the real me.
01:34:17: I was always afraid
of what you might say
01:34:19: or how you're going
to feel or whatever.
01:34:21: You got feelings.
01:34:24: You have a life that
you have to live.
01:34:26: So it's important that
whatever's on your mind,
01:34:29: you let that person know.
01:34:30: Therefore, you're
giving them the option
01:34:32: to be with you or not.
01:34:34: This is who I am.
01:34:36: If you don't like
it, that's good, man.
01:34:37: I got it.
01:34:38: But this is David Goggins.
01:34:40: So that honest conversation
is very important, man,
01:34:43: so everybody knows
where they stand.
01:34:45: That person may not be for you.
01:34:48: And that's all good.
01:34:49: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This world could
01:34:50: use a lot more of that upfront,
completely honest conversation.
01:34:53: I feel like so much of
the world's problems
01:34:56: are because everyone's
dancing around these issues.
01:34:59: DAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot.
01:34:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Recently in the news,
01:35:00: seeing people losing
their job because they
01:35:02: won't say something publicly.
01:35:03: You can tell they
kind of what it.
01:35:04: It's like, people just,
I think, deep down really
01:35:07: crave the direct message.
01:35:08: Like, what are you about?
01:35:10: What are you not about?
01:35:10: But I think now, everyone's
afraid of getting canceled.
01:35:14: It's a big deal, getting
canceled, that people think,
01:35:17: oh, I can't work
if I am who I am.
01:35:19: Or if I'm not pretending
to be somebody else,
01:35:23: then silence is
considered agreement.
01:35:28: There's all sorts of
complicated stuff.
01:35:30: And I do feel for the
generation coming up
01:35:33: because we didn't have
social media and all of that.
01:35:36: Again, just walled
off from that.
01:35:38: There's a real benefit from
just not paying attention.
01:35:40: DAVID GOGGINS:
People love to lie.
01:35:42: People love to lie.
01:35:43: You know, I thought
I was only a person--
01:35:45: when I was growing
up, I thought I
01:35:47: was the only person that lied
because I lived in a bubble.
01:35:49: And people love to lie
about who they're not.
01:35:53: They love to lie about
who they're not, dude.
01:35:55: And that's, for me, the
reason why I'm so vulnerable,
01:36:00: and I'm so real and honest.
01:36:04: Find somebody to
come out and tell me
01:36:06: I'm lying about my fucking life.
01:36:08: And for me to come
where I came from
01:36:10: and have the resume
I have now, you
01:36:12: know the confidence you get?
01:36:14: How I don't care who--
you're going to-- you're
01:36:17: going to judge me?
01:36:18: You're going to judge me?
01:36:19: What have you done in your life?
01:36:20: So me, being so honest and
so upfront and so truthful,
01:36:25: that came with me finally
figuring out who I was,
01:36:30: but also conquering David
Goggins, the demons of David
01:36:34: Goggins.
01:36:35: Therefore, now, you're
just an open book.
01:36:37: You look at somebody, look
them right in the eye.
01:36:39: Tell me exactly who
the fuck you are.
01:36:41: You walk away.
01:36:42: I'm good, bro, because I know
exactly what this journey took
01:36:45: to get here.
01:36:46: And that gives you a fire
and a passion that people
01:36:49: can call you nigger,
they can call you--
01:36:51: if you're a lesbian or
gay or bise-- call me
01:36:54: whatever the fuck you want.
01:36:55: If you put yourself in
the fire and you come out
01:36:59: every fucking day like this,
brush it off, not scared
01:37:01: to go back in there
again, come on, man.
01:37:04: Your truth is real.
01:37:06: You come out every
day, man, with a way
01:37:08: of talking to people that people
don't have because there's
01:37:11: no truth behind them.
01:37:13: And the truth is
the starting line.
01:37:14: When you sit down the ugly
mirror and say, I'm this,
01:37:16: I'm this, I'm this and this,
you finally started your life.
01:37:19: Maybe 40 years old.
01:37:22: Maybe 40 years old,
five, six kids, wife.
01:37:25: But the second you look in that
mirror and you say, I'm this,
01:37:28: I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,
I'm this, well, basically,
01:37:31: I'm not this, I'm not this,
I'm not this, I can't do this,
01:37:34: I can't do this, I'm
all these insecurities,
01:37:37: your life finally started.
01:37:39: And once you start that
life, man, the truth
01:37:41: comes out big time because
you no longer care.
01:37:43: So that's the problem.
01:37:44: Most people just don't want
to have that conversation
01:37:47: to the point where they can go
on stage and a million people
01:37:49: and say, I'm all of this.
01:37:54: And have a good day.
01:37:56: See you.
01:37:57: It's empowering.
01:37:59: It's very empowering.
01:38:00: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like the
way we're educated in school,
01:38:04: but also outside of school, is
we're trained, as human being,
01:38:07: as these young brains,
to try and figure out
01:38:09: how to get positive
feedback from other people.
01:38:11: It's like we're little dogs.
01:38:14: You have a bulldog.
01:38:15: DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.
01:38:15: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I had a bulldog.
01:38:17: Saw the picture of your bulldog.
01:38:18: She's great.
01:38:19: DAVID GOGGINS: Charlie dog.
01:38:20: ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're
an amazing species.
01:38:21: DAVID GOGGINS: They are.
01:38:22: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
of them economy of effort
01:38:25: or amazing breed, excuse me.
01:38:26: They're an amazing breed.
01:38:27: Economy of effort.
01:38:28: They don't do anything
unless it's necessary.
01:38:31: It's the exact opposite of
everything we're talking about.
01:38:33: It's kind of interesting.
01:38:34: And they're kind of hedonists.
01:38:36: Now, it is true that
they'll die to protect you.
01:38:39: DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah.
01:38:40: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's an instinct.
01:38:41: I saw that with Costello.
01:38:42: I'm sure that--
01:38:43: DAVID GOGGINS: I
saw it with Charlie.
01:38:43: Yeah.
01:38:44: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's an instinct.
01:38:45: But if they're not
in that position,
01:38:48: if there's no need
to exert effort--
01:38:50: DAVID GOGGINS: They're resting.
01:38:50: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
01:38:51: So your bulldog's
resting for you.
01:38:53: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
01:38:54: Got it.
01:38:54: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.
01:38:55: So you don't need
to rest because--
01:38:56: DAVID GOGGINS: Active
recovery Charlie.
01:38:58: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.
01:38:58: DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.
01:38:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.
01:38:59: That's going to be your
answer from now on.
01:39:01: People go, does he sleep?
01:39:02: Does he rest?
01:39:02: Go, no.
01:39:02: He somehow worked it out so
his bulldog does it for him.
01:39:05: DAVID GOGGINS: Right.
01:39:06: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But we're sort of
01:39:08: indoctrinated into
this way of being
01:39:10: from a time that we're
young, where, of course,
01:39:13: praise feels good.
01:39:15: Someone tells you, hey, I like
that shirt, or good job today,
01:39:19: or nicely done.
01:39:20: Or for me, because growing up
in a big pack of friends growing
01:39:24: up, and I was never the greatest
athlete, wasn't terrible,
01:39:27: wasn't great, et cetera, like,
a fist bump, or, like, feeling
01:39:30: crewed up.
01:39:30: And you're just like, yeah.
01:39:32: But you've talked about
this before in reference
01:39:34: to the SEAL Teams.
01:39:36: We both know a lot of
people in that community.
01:39:38: And the Teams component is a big
part of it for a lot of people.
01:39:40: And it's a wonderful thing.
01:39:43: But there's a danger
to that dopamine hit,
01:39:47: for lack of a better
way to put it,
01:39:49: from we can only derive when
it's coming from the outside.
01:39:55: You're talking about being
able to either say, good job,
01:39:59: but also, just look to one's
own personal history and say,
01:40:03: I've done hard things.
01:40:05: And I can do it again and again
because I do it again and again
01:40:08: and again.
01:40:08: You're talking about parenting
yourself, inspiring yourself,
01:40:15: scaring yourself, all
of that from the inside.
01:40:18: So very different
than the way we're
01:40:21: raised, which is to figure
out how to get the biscuit.
01:40:23: DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man.
01:40:24: People want to know how
I'm always motivated.
01:40:29: It's the unseen work, which you
just said is a true statement.
01:40:32: Those are false dopamine
hits that people
01:40:34: are giving you, man.
01:40:36: There's no belief in that.
01:40:38: These are teamwork
dopamine-- like, I'm out
01:40:41: running at 2 o'clock
in the morning, 1
01:40:43: o'clock in the morning in the
gym, long sessions by myself.
01:40:48: That's real.
01:40:50: I'm able to extract dopamine,
the good dopamine whenever
01:40:54: I want.
01:40:55: Man, I've trained
99% of my life alone.
01:41:01: No one patted me on the back.
01:41:03: I did all of the work alone.
01:41:07: And while I'm still hard on
myself, I know what I did.
01:41:11: So whenever times
get bad for me,
01:41:13: people are all this, who's going
to carry the boats and lo--
01:41:16: that's real.
01:41:17: I hate that people
know me for that guy
01:41:20: because that guy is
not every fucking day.
01:41:23: When they see me,
they want that energy.
01:41:26: That's not me every day.
01:41:27: I can extract it
immediately when I need to
01:41:30: because when you train alone--
01:41:32: and I lived alone for so
many years in this misery.
01:41:35: And you're able to
get out by yourself.
01:41:38: I can take myself to such
a level of real passion
01:41:42: and purpose.
01:41:43: And the feeling I
get is something
01:41:46: I can't even explain by mys--
01:41:48: I don't need anyone.
01:41:50: That's why people come
to me to motivate them.
01:41:52: No one can motivate me.
01:41:55: I have a resume full
of fucking motivation
01:41:58: that whenever I'm down, I'm
like, oh hang on, motherfucker.
01:42:02: Oh, you know the truth.
01:42:04: You know the truth.
01:42:05: You know the darkness
of the fucking dungeons
01:42:07: and the fucking demons that fly.
01:42:09: And then from there,
it's like, OK.
01:42:12: You were there.
01:42:13: You know this.
01:42:14: There was no one
there to pick up
01:42:15: the rucksack, to pick
up the boat, to pick up
01:42:17: the log, to go in there.
01:42:19: It was you.
01:42:20: It was you.
01:42:20: There was no pat on the fucking
back at 300, at 275, at 250,
01:42:25: at 220.
01:42:25: No.
01:42:26: That was you.
01:42:28: So those things
that come out of me,
01:42:30: that extract from me
in the darkness, people
01:42:33: are looking for that
pat on the back.
01:42:34: Where is it?
01:42:35: Oh, I don't need it
because what I've done
01:42:40: is in the fucking unseen work.
01:42:44: I built Frankenstein.
01:42:47: So whenever shit gets
nasty, David Goggins
01:42:50: goes, you had nobody
anyway, motherfucker.
01:42:53: So see how I'm talking
to myself right now?
01:42:55: That's me.
01:42:57: That's shit fires
me the fuck up.
01:42:59: That shit makes me fucking nuts.
01:43:00: You had nobody
anyway, motherfucker.
01:43:03: Look around you.
01:43:04: There was no fucking team.
01:43:06: It was you.
01:43:07: There was no weight loss program
or mom and dad waking you up,
01:43:11: saying you can do it, you can be
better, trying to build belief.
01:43:14: You built belief
when you had nothing.
01:43:17: Rock bottom.
01:43:20: You did that.
01:43:20: So as times get hard for
me, the truth comes out.
01:43:26: And my truth is
powerful as fuck.
01:43:29: It's real.
01:43:31: It's tangible.
01:43:32: I feel it.
01:43:33: It comes out of my brain
as I speak about it.
01:43:36: I'm reliving every single dark
moment of my life to be here.
01:43:43: So that is what
people don't get.
01:43:46: That is what motivates David
Goggins is the unseen work.
01:43:50: But everybody needs
that pat on the back.
01:43:53: They need that training partner.
01:43:54: They need that
accountability coach.
01:43:57: I don't need that shit.
01:43:58: And neither do they.
01:44:00: But it's what we've
trained ourselves
01:44:02: to believe that we need.
01:44:03: ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
almost like there's
01:44:05: this pill on the shelf.
01:44:06: I'm speaking in analogy.
01:44:08: And we take it, and
we get jazzed up.
01:44:11: And we're like, yeah.
01:44:13: But there's this other
medicine cabinet behind there.
01:44:16: And it's in us.
01:44:16: You're saying the real
medicine cabinet is inside.
01:44:19: DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes.
01:44:20: When you continue to overcome--
01:44:23: and I had so many
obstacles to overcome.
01:44:25: So it's actually
a benefit to me.
01:44:27: But the benefit, it's not
like a benefit like that.
01:44:29: You have to have the
courage and the patience
01:44:32: to overcome and overcome.
01:44:34: Before you know it, man, you
have a whole medicine cabinet.
01:44:38: But there's no medicine
in the motherfucker.
01:44:40: There's no pre-workout.
01:44:42: I don't take none of that shit.
01:44:44: All I got to do
is flip my brain.
01:44:48: Put my finger in there and
say, OK, that's a good one.
01:44:51: It's all I got to do, man.
01:44:52: I got the Rolodex.
01:44:53: I'm just like, go fuck
yourself, Goggins.
01:44:55: And oh, but you won.
01:44:58: Let's do that one today.
01:44:59: There's nothing I need.
01:45:02: And this is the
thing that people
01:45:03: don't get about David Goggins.
01:45:05: I can't teach it in
a 1-minute video.
01:45:10: We all have this ability to
have our own medicine cabinet.
01:45:15: But unless you go in there
and put the medicine in there,
01:45:21: it's always going to
be fucking empty, man.
01:45:23: You're always going to
need the pre-workout.
01:45:25: You're always
going to need the--
01:45:26: I don't drink coffee.
01:45:27: I don't do ca--
01:45:28: I don't do none of that.
01:45:28: I don't need it.
01:45:29: I can run for 70 hours, and
I have before, no caffeine.
01:45:35: I got all this wonderful shit
that I overcame on my own,
01:45:40: by myself, in the darkness,
that, man, when it's cold,
01:45:44: I'm hot.
01:45:46: When it's hot--
01:45:48: I can feed myself all the time.
01:45:52: That's why when people
say, man, why aren't you
01:45:54: missing anything, I can't
explain it to you, man.
01:45:58: Can't explain it to you.
01:45:59: You'll never understand.
01:46:01: That's why I don't do
all these podcasts, dude.
01:46:04: I love you, man.
01:46:05: That's why you-- my first
book, you did a blurb for me.
01:46:09: That's why I'm here.
01:46:10: I love what you're
doing for people, man.
01:46:12: But I can't explain this.
01:46:15: I can't.
01:46:15: I can't explain this because
people don't want to do this.
01:46:18: They don't want to do this, man.
01:46:19: But I don't know, man.
01:46:22: I get jazzed up even
talking about it,
01:46:23: man, because so many people
think my life is just so, oh
01:46:27: god, his life is horrible.
01:46:29: Don't follow him.
01:46:30: He's crazy.
01:46:30: Really?
01:46:31: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But there
are a good number of people,
01:46:34: I would say, and that's an
under-- that actually do.
01:46:36: I think what I'm hearing today,
and it's really sinking in, is
01:46:40: that a great many people
either partially or completely
01:46:43: misunderstand you.
01:46:45: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
01:46:46: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll put myself
in the partially category.
01:46:48: DAVID GOGGINS: Big time.
01:46:49: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Because I thought
01:46:50: it was about just forward
center of mass, carrot, carrot,
01:46:55: carrot, carrot.
01:46:57: But it's the stick.
01:46:58: DAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick.
01:46:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's being haunted.
01:47:00: And you know, I do have examples
from my own life, which is not
01:47:03: what today is about,
about being really afraid
01:47:06: and then turning things around.
01:47:08: My biggest fear is
getting comfortable.
01:47:10: I do not have as much of
a stick-oriented approach.
01:47:14: But today's conversation's
changing the way I think.
01:47:18: I'm not going to
step away from this
01:47:19: and think, OK, there are
25 neural circuits that
01:47:22: can explain 10 of the things
that David's talking about.
01:47:24: And what I'm thinking
about is the fact
01:47:27: that everybody has a brain.
01:47:28: They have a mind.
01:47:30: Forget the brain.
01:47:31: The brain's just the
physical structure.
01:47:32: But what that manifests, what
that creates is the mind.
01:47:37: And everybody has that.
01:47:39: So I do believe that
everyone has the capacity
01:47:42: to do what you're talking
about at some level.
01:47:46: I also will be the
first to confess
01:47:49: that I think you
are highly unusual.
01:47:51: Let's just say maybe even n
of 1, as we say in science.
01:47:56: Sample size of one.
01:47:59: Somebody who has created
this process for themselves
01:48:01: and keeps them in
this-- themselves
01:48:03: in this forward center
of mass with the stick
01:48:06: battering the back of
their head all the time.
01:48:09: Highly unusual.
01:48:12: But this internal
medicine cabinet
01:48:14: that you're talking
about building up,
01:48:15: true confidence, not needing
anything from the outside,
01:48:18: I like to think that
people want that.
01:48:23: They want to be known.
01:48:24: They're afraid.
01:48:26: But that they want to be
known for who they really are
01:48:29: and that you're describing
the path to do this.
01:48:31: And I will say I'm immensely
grateful that you're
01:48:34: talking to us this
way today about things
01:48:36: that you've talked about before.
01:48:37: But we're hitting it a little
differently, I like to think.
01:48:40: DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently.
01:48:41: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
what you're talking about
01:48:45: is a process.
01:48:46: It's verbs.
01:48:46: It's all verbs.
01:48:47: DAVID GOGGINS: All action.
01:48:49: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's not about success.
01:48:51: It's more, actually,
about keeping
01:48:54: that friction dialed to 10.
01:48:57: And no energy drink,
no supplement.
01:48:59: People often misunderstand me.
01:49:00: They think-- like, I'm big
on people getting sunlight
01:49:03: in the morning so they
set their circadian rhythm
01:49:04: and get better sleep and
so they can-- et cetera.
01:49:06: But then people always
think-- they go straight
01:49:08: to the supplements.
01:49:09: What should I take?
01:49:10: And then, of
course, people think
01:49:11: I'm all about supplements.
01:49:12: And supplements are
one piece for me.
01:49:14: But it's like tiny fraction
compared to the doing,
01:49:17: the do's and don'ts.
01:49:18: DAVID GOGGINS:
That's why I didn't
01:49:19: want to talk about that today.
01:49:20: That's why I'm glad
we're talking about this.
01:49:22: This is it.
01:49:23: This is it.
01:49:24: Like, the brain is the most
powerful weapon in the world.
01:49:27: And it's crazy how a kid
that wasn't real smart,
01:49:33: I was forced to
go only internal.
01:49:37: External had to go away.
01:49:39: The external world
had to go away.
01:49:41: In living so deep inside
myself, it was me in this brain
01:49:46: and figuring out how
this thing works.
01:49:48: And so many people are doing
exactly that, the supplements,
01:49:54: the this, the that.
01:49:55: And I agree, it helps.
01:49:58: But once you figure
out your brain,
01:50:03: you become unstoppable
to almost anything.
01:50:07: Yeah, you can't beat death.
01:50:09: You can't whatever, whatever.
01:50:10: Your brain is amazing.
01:50:12: Once you feed it the right
conversation, the right mental
01:50:17: nutrients, the right
mental supplements,
01:50:21: the right internal
dialogue at the right time
01:50:25: with the right hit, with the
right proof of what you've
01:50:29: done in the past, and
you send that right
01:50:32: to the right circuit, dude,
you're a fucking beast.
01:50:36: A beast.
01:50:37: But once again, you just
can't read about it.
01:50:43: You can't sit back
and be a theorist.
01:50:46: You have to be a
fucking practitioner.
01:50:49: And in that practice is where
that becomes proof-positive
01:50:53: of what I'm saying.
01:50:54: It's like, god, David
Goggins is blowing my mind.
01:50:58: What is this?
01:50:59: He's not crazy.
01:51:00: And so many people,
a lot of people,
01:51:09: have listened to
me the right way.
01:51:10: And they come back, and they're
like, I'm totally on board.
01:51:14: It happened.
01:51:16: It happened.
01:51:16: I'm like, it'll keep going,
man, if you keep doing it.
01:51:20: But that is it, man.
01:51:21: There's no sun.
01:51:24: There's no glory.
01:51:25: There's no carrot.
01:51:27: There's no victory.
01:51:29: But there is all of it in one.
01:51:30: I just can't explain it
real well to people, man.
01:51:32: But what you get the
other end is something
01:51:36: that you're always found.
01:51:39: You're never lost anymore.
01:51:41: Doesn't mean the
journey is easy.
01:51:43: Doesn't get any easier.
01:51:44: But you're always found.
01:51:46: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.
01:51:47: I just want to hover
on that for a sec
01:51:49: the same way we hovered
on haunted and the stick.
01:51:53: I think people feel lost.
01:51:55: I've certainly felt lost at
times in my life, many times.
01:51:59: And yeah, there's that thing.
01:52:01: I don't think there's a
neuroscience or a psychology
01:52:04: term for it.
01:52:04: Someone will put it in the
comments and say, oh yeah,
01:52:06: that's what so-and-so said.
01:52:08: But like you said, we're not
trying to be theoretical here.
01:52:10: We're trying to be practical.
01:52:11: The business of finding
yourself and knowing, oh.
01:52:16: But it's sort of like I'm
safe because I'm in danger,
01:52:20: and I've been in danger
before, and I got myself out.
01:52:23: It always seems to
come back to verbs.
01:52:25: Again, I don't have
a language for this.
01:52:27: For once, I'm lost for words.
01:52:29: There's like-- it's about
a process, the algorithm.
01:52:33: And the reason-- here, I'm just
kind of trying to make sure
01:52:36: I'm understanding
things correctly.
01:52:38: One of the reasons why
it must be uncomfortable
01:52:40: for you to be who
you are publicly
01:52:42: is because people want to focus
on the running or the swearing.
01:52:46: And by the way, the
swearing is welcome.
01:52:49: I'll tell you, I came
up through laboratories
01:52:51: where all three people I
worked for swore a lot.
01:52:56: But there was one rule.
01:52:58: I couldn't swear at people.
01:52:59: So my graduate advisor,
brilliant woman,
01:53:02: unfortunately, she died
early, they all died early--
01:53:05: I'm the common denominator.
01:53:07: I had that internalized
for a long time.
01:53:08: Anyway, she said, but if you
swear at people, you're out.
01:53:12: But you can swear
as much as you want.
01:53:13: So that's the rule I have.
01:53:15: It's like, you can swear
as much as you want.
01:53:16: Just don't swear at people.
01:53:17: And if you swear at people,
better be ready to fight.
01:53:20: Definitely not
going to fight you.
01:53:21: So you can swear at
me, get away with it.
01:53:22: But the fact of the
matter is that it must
01:53:25: be frustrating that people--
01:53:27: because I know
people go, oh, it's
01:53:29: all about supplements
and ice baths.
01:53:31: Listen, I like supplements.
01:53:32: I love supplements
and ice baths.
01:53:33: But that's not the full picture.
01:53:34: It's just a gravitational pull.
01:53:36: It's the swearing.
01:53:37: It's the running.
01:53:38: It's his feet that
are all messed up.
01:53:40: It's the fact that
he got a Triton.
01:53:42: He's a SEAL guy.
01:53:44: Talk about that too.
01:53:46: And there's a gravitational
pull for people.
01:53:49: And they're missing-- that's
the tip of the iceberg,
01:53:53: is what I'm realizing.
01:53:53: I'm realizing that
today thanks to the way
01:53:56: you're phrasing things
because the bigger vessel
01:53:58: is all in here.
01:53:59: And as you said, how do
you put that in a book?
01:54:01: DAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible.
01:54:03: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
it's highly individual.
01:54:04: You do it your way.
01:54:05: And you're saying,
everyone needs
01:54:07: to go figure out how to
do it their way for them.
01:54:09: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
01:54:10: And the thing about
being misunderstood,
01:54:13: it's very frustrating, more
than I can even imagine.
01:54:17: I can't even express
how frustrating
01:54:19: it is when the cussing
and everything comes
01:54:24: from a place of real.
01:54:27: I can't explain what
I do without it.
01:54:31: The passion comes out of me.
01:54:32: It's almost like speaking in
tongues because when you put
01:54:35: that much work-- and
people go, oh yeah,
01:54:37: there's been this basketball
player, this football player,
01:54:40: this--
01:54:42: dude.
01:54:44: No.
01:54:45: No.
01:54:46: Everything, everything is work.
01:54:51: Everything.
01:54:51: And people don't believe it.
01:54:53: So when I speak, the
motherfucker and the fuck
01:54:59: and the shit, that is
what it took for me,
01:55:05: what it takes for me, the anger,
the passion, the jaw-dropping--
01:55:15: just it takes that
because I'm not that.
01:55:20: This is how I look at it, man.
01:55:23: What built this guy?
01:55:25: Let's imagine being
in the coldest
01:55:26: water you can possibly take.
01:55:28: I always go back to
Hell Week with this.
01:55:30: I hated that water.
01:55:32: Hated it.
01:55:34: You're sitting there locked
arms, and you're in the water
01:55:36: all the time.
01:55:37: And they're bringing you
in and out of the water,
01:55:39: in and out of the water.
01:55:42: When you have this
dialogue in your head,
01:55:44: and these people are judging me
off a freaking 1-minute video,
01:55:49: and you're constantly
your whole life,
01:55:51: when you figured it out
at 24, that I got to--
01:55:54: I just got to, just
fucking got to,
01:55:57: and this is just going to suck.
01:55:58: Every day it's going to suck.
01:56:00: And live like that to be better.
01:56:03: And I put it this way.
01:56:04: I'm in the water.
01:56:05: The water is going over my
head, the Pacific Ocean.
01:56:07: It's freezing.
01:56:09: February.
01:56:10: Cold as shit.
01:56:11: Been through three Hell Weeks.
01:56:15: For you to constantly
win, win, win,
01:56:19: when this voice over
here, the real you,
01:56:22: is saying get the fuck out
of here, go, you're nobody.
01:56:27: You've always been nobody.
01:56:29: And it's true.
01:56:31: People don't hear that.
01:56:33: That's a true voice.
01:56:34: That's a real reality of
David Goggins at 24 years old.
01:56:39: It's not a false reality.
01:56:41: And then you had to create
another voice over here that
01:56:46: is saying, you're better
than that other voice.
01:56:48: And you're in the
freezing cold water
01:56:51: that both voices don't
want to fucking be in.
01:56:56: But you win.
01:56:59: Then goes from the
water to the studying
01:57:02: to the running to
the losing weight
01:57:04: to how you eat to how
you function as a man.
01:57:06: Every day of your life,
you're winning these battles.
01:57:10: And then I have normal people
who only have one voice.
01:57:16: Never created the second voice.
01:57:18: The winning voice
is the second voice.
01:57:19: They have one voice.
01:57:22: And that's just,
I'm a piece of shit.
01:57:25: And that's all they hear.
01:57:28: And then they judge
people like me
01:57:31: who are out here
trying to be better.
01:57:35: It's something that
I can never really--
01:57:39: it's a frustrating
thing for me because I
01:57:43: know the majority of people.
01:57:45: I know what goes on in the
brain because I studied the mind
01:57:48: more than almost-- more than
you because I'm a practitioner.
01:57:53: So for you to be a piece of
shit and come out of that,
01:57:56: you don't just come out of it.
01:57:58: You spend decades studying
your mind and the human mind
01:58:05: on how it functions in good
environments, bad environments,
01:58:09: stressful environments,
patient environments.
01:58:12: You study it all because
you had to put all this
01:58:14: together to create the
mind to become successful.
01:58:18: So I had to-- it wasn't like
God blessed me with this brain.
01:58:22: I had to create a mind.
01:58:24: And so in doing
so, I figured out
01:58:26: every piece of shit
human being in the world
01:58:28: because that's what I was
going off of for myself.
01:58:32: So I know why you
go on Instagram.
01:58:34: I know why you-- because
you just have the time.
01:58:39: You have the time
because you don't
01:58:42: want to put that time
into bettering oneself.
01:58:46: So I know why I'm misunderstood.
01:58:49: I'm misunderstood by people
who have plenty of time
01:58:53: on their hands to misunderstand
me because they are exactly
01:58:56: where I once was, which is a
low-life, lazy piece of shit.
01:59:01: And it's the harsh reality
of people who troll you,
01:59:04: who go after you.
01:59:06: They have nothing better
to do with their lives.
01:59:09: It's not some after
school special.
01:59:11: It's the truth.
01:59:12: But I once was that way.
01:59:15: I know where it all comes from.
01:59:17: That's why it's
frustrating to me
01:59:18: now because I'm not so
frustrated at the fact
01:59:20: that I'm being trolled.
01:59:22: I'm frustrated by
the fact that you
01:59:23: don't have the
courage, the courage
01:59:26: to try to be somebody
better than what you're not.
01:59:29: And that's the frustrating part.
01:59:31: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's interesting
01:59:33: because earlier, we were
talking about relationships.
01:59:36: And you said, in
a very candid way,
01:59:39: and I really appreciate
you sharing that,
01:59:41: that you make sure
that the people close
01:59:42: to you, your family,
has everything they need
01:59:44: and that they also
understand that you're
01:59:46: going to take what you need to
continue to build you period.
01:59:49: DAVID GOGGINS: Period.
01:59:50: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
In some ways, it
01:59:53: seems you've also included the
general public in that family.
01:59:57: You're saying, listen, I'm
going to give you what you need.
02:00:01: I'm going to give you as
much of myself as I can,
02:00:03: except I'm going to
stop right at the line
02:00:06: that if I were to
cross it is going
02:00:08: to prevent me from
continuing to build myself.
02:00:11: And by the way,
this relationship
02:00:13: only exists because I
don't cross that line.
02:00:17: And I think as much as there
are detractors out there
02:00:21: or people that try--
02:00:23: I mean, whatever they're doing
is pretty feeble, in my mind.
02:00:26: I mean, it's like cap
gun fire, it that.
02:00:29: DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble.
02:00:32: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,
men and women, old and young,
02:00:37: hear something and feel
something in your message.
02:00:41: Like, yeah, it
seems kind of crazy.
02:00:43: Gosh.
02:00:44: Doesn't he ever just relax?
02:00:46: What about his sleep?
02:00:47: Look at his feet.
02:00:48: He's going to-- he's
going to injure himself.
02:00:50: Listen, I'll be very direct.
02:00:51: I got friends who were in the
Teams who just go, what's he
02:00:54: going to do when he can't run?
02:00:55: And I know the answer
is keep running.
02:00:57: DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.
02:00:58: ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
it's more comfortable
02:01:00: for people, even
high achievers--
02:01:02: DAVID GOGGINS: Especially
high achievers.
02:01:04: ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to
believe that if you
02:01:05: took one thing away, that
it would all go away.
02:01:07: It's absolutely clear that's
not the case with you.
02:01:10: I'm 100% convinced.
02:01:12: I just know that because
we're talking about this.
02:01:14: DAVID GOGGINS: Do you
know how many times
02:01:14: I haven't been able to run?
02:01:16: Two heart surgeries.
02:01:17: Multiple knee surgeries.
02:01:18: And after every knee
surgery, they said,
02:01:20: you're not going to run again.
02:01:22: And I'm fine with that.
02:01:24: There's no running up here, bro.
02:01:26: None.
02:01:27: This was what it was all about.
02:01:29: That's what they lost.
02:01:30: What if you can't run?
02:01:31: Give a fuck.
02:01:33: It was never about running.
02:01:35: Why do you think I run?
02:01:37: It's the worst thing.
02:01:39: I hate doing it
more than anything.
02:01:43: Hence the willpower.
02:01:44: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
02:01:45: Your anterior
mid-cingulate cortex
02:01:46: DAVID GOGGINS:
Hence the willpower.
02:01:47: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--would start to regress
02:01:49: if you loved running.
02:01:50: DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it.
02:01:51: Every day, I wake up.
02:01:53: I don't just run
a mile, two miles.
02:01:56: It's the one thing I
hate the most to do.
02:02:00: And I do it like I love it.
02:02:03: 250, 260, 300-mile
runs at one time.
02:02:08: No sleep.
02:02:09: And every step, when I get
to the-- think about this.
02:02:11: I get to the fucking start
line cussing at Jennifer.
02:02:16: Why the fuck am I here?
02:02:17: I hate this shit.
02:02:21: After 70-some hours of
running, every fucking
02:02:24: question I ever had is answered.
02:02:27: Every question I
had is answered.
02:02:29: I capped success.
02:02:33: People go, what do you
mean, you capped success?
02:02:37: For me to be who I am--
02:02:41: so when I go smokejump, I smoke
jump three to four months out
02:02:47: of the year, sometimes five.
02:02:48: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could
you, just for those
02:02:50: that aren't educated
about-- just
02:02:52: give us a brief description
of what smokejumping entails.
02:02:55: DAVID GOGGINS: So basically,
you jump into fires.
02:02:59: Not into them, but you jump by
fires that people can't get to.
02:03:02: ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out
of planes and helicopters.
02:03:04: DAVID GOGGINS:
Right, out of planes.
02:03:06: I parachute.
02:03:07: It's all parachuting.
02:03:08: So you parachute
out of airplanes.
02:03:10: And then you fight the fire, you
and sometimes four other guys
02:03:13: or maybe eight other
guys, guys and gals.
02:03:15: And you're putting
this fire out.
02:03:18: So I lose millions of dollars
every summer to do this.
02:03:23: It blows people's minds.
02:03:24: Why the hell are you doing this?
02:03:25: ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
you're breathing soot.
02:03:27: DAVID GOGGINS: I'm
breathing soot.
02:03:28: Knees are jacked up.
02:03:29: Hitting the ground.
02:03:30: Hurting.
02:03:31: Whatever.
02:03:32: Talking to normal people,
they'll never get it,
02:03:34: so I don't even
explain it to them.
02:03:37: But this is why-- this is
why I call it capped success.
02:03:40: I'm talking financial success.
02:03:42: For me to continue having that
willpower, the second I just
02:03:48: become a speaking
monkey and travel around
02:03:52: and speaking gigs 12
months out of the year,
02:03:54: put camps on, do this, put on
lectures, get supplement lines
02:03:59: and do this and write
more books and shit,
02:04:01: I've ruined the exact thing
I worked on my entire life.
02:04:08: And while I didn't
know it until the day,
02:04:10: but something
always told me, this
02:04:13: is a very, very, very
perishable skill, this willpower
02:04:17: that you have, because I do have
a willpower that I have never
02:04:20: seen in anybody in my life.
02:04:22: It is a haunting force
that just keeps me going.
02:04:25: And I know that
that is my strength.
02:04:28: If you have that-- so that's
worth every dime I've ever
02:04:33: made in my life is the fact
I can look a man in the eye
02:04:37: finally and have a
real conversation
02:04:39: without going like
this because I'm lying,
02:04:42: or I'm a piece of shit.
02:04:43: Or I know-- you
know how a person--
02:04:45: and so many people do this shit.
02:04:47: They're talking to you
on who they want to be.
02:04:51: They're lying to you.
02:04:54: And they walk away--
02:04:55: I've done it so many times.
02:04:56: You walk away like, god, man.
02:04:57: If I could just
tell them the truth.
02:04:59: Why the hell can't I
just tell him the truth?
02:05:03: Know how good it
feels for me now
02:05:04: to look at you in
your eye and every man
02:05:08: I see because women
won't get this.
02:05:10: Women will not get this.
02:05:13: Man to man, that
man shit, when you
02:05:15: look another man
in the eye, and you
02:05:17: know that everything you're
fucking saying is real,
02:05:19: and it comes from a real
working place, something
02:05:22: that you earned, it's the
best feeling in the world.
02:05:25: ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can
say that actually happened.
02:05:27: Like, I know with certainty what
I'm saying actually happened.
02:05:30: DAVID GOGGINS:
Actually happened.
02:05:31: Who I am and who
I say I am, I am.
02:05:34: No more lies.
02:05:36: No more skirting the truth.
02:05:38: No more bullshit.
02:05:39: And that is worth every dime
I've ever made in my life.
02:05:43: And I swear to God on that.
02:05:47: Every dime I've ever made in
my life, building who I built,
02:05:51: so I capped success
because I know
02:05:54: that if I ever go 12
months out of the year
02:05:58: and don't put several--
every day, I'm going at it.
02:06:01: But several months
out of the year,
02:06:03: I go right back to
ground zero, which means
02:06:06: I'm just fucking David Goggins.
02:06:09: No Goggins.
02:06:10: No carry boats,
fucking logs bullshit.
02:06:13: It's just pick up that
fucking Pulaski and dig.
02:06:17: Hey, get that fucking pump.
02:06:20: Walk down a mile.
02:06:21: Put it in the fucking water.
02:06:22: Mosquitoes beating--
you're just David Goggins.
02:06:25: You're nobody because
that's where my growth is.
02:06:28: That's where my
willpower comes from.
02:06:31: And that's where it stays.
02:06:32: That's why when I talk to
you now-- and can't nobody
02:06:35: talk like this, dude.
02:06:36: People don't talk with
this kind of passion
02:06:38: because it ain't there.
02:06:39: It ain't there.
02:06:40: They're regurgitating some
shit from 30 fucking years ago.
02:06:44: I'm regurgitating
shit from an hour ago.
02:06:47: Hour ago.
02:06:49: Come on, man.
02:06:49: It's just be real.
02:06:53: And I can't be on
these podcasts.
02:06:55: I can't talk to anybody
without being real.
02:06:57: I'll go away.
02:06:59: I'll just go away
because I can't give you
02:07:02: what I want to give you.
02:07:05: ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
said perishable skill.
02:07:07: I think that's
another set of words
02:07:09: I want to highlight because
skill implies behavior.
02:07:12: And when we were just
talking a second ago
02:07:14: about the deep, true bedrock
sense of confidence that
02:07:19: comes from looking
someone in the eye
02:07:21: and telling somebody
something that you absolutely
02:07:23: know it's true
because it happened,
02:07:25: you're talking about actions.
02:07:27: Not talking about perceptions.
02:07:29: You're not talking about
what you believe happened.
02:07:32: You know it happened.
02:07:33: And there's something really
concrete about actions.
02:07:35: I mean, that's what's
so interesting is
02:07:37: we're talking about the mind.
02:07:38: But actions are the
manifestation of the mind.
02:07:42: And the stuff that just stays
in here, people die with that.
02:07:47: It doesn't go anywhere.
02:07:49: Long ago, somebody said--
02:07:51: I forget what the context was.
02:07:52: It was a neuroscientist.
02:07:53: He said, most emotions,
they're just emotions.
02:07:57: They're just in there.
02:07:58: You don't have to do
anything with them.
02:08:00: And I think certain emotions
you want to do something with.
02:08:03: But I think people forget this.
02:08:04: They feel miserable,
like they're
02:08:05: going to dissolve into a
puddle of their own tears.
02:08:07: No one ever died
from an emotion.
02:08:09: But they feel-- they overwhelm
us as if it's a tidal wave.
02:08:13: It's going to pull us
under and drown us.
02:08:15: It's so interesting to me
because I think what people--
02:08:18: listen, you have a
gravitational pull.
02:08:20: People can feel the energy.
02:08:22: I think, yes, you're
either completely badly
02:08:26: or partially understood.
02:08:27: There's only one
guy on the planet
02:08:29: that truly understands you.
02:08:30: I think there's one
woman, Jennifer,
02:08:32: who probably understands you
as much as anyone's going to.
02:08:34: And then the rest of us
are kind of grasping,
02:08:36: trying to figure it out.
02:08:38: But you're saying, go inward.
02:08:40: So first, go inward.
02:08:43: And then it's actions.
02:08:45: Inward and actions.
02:08:46: Now, the inward
piece is something
02:08:47: I'd like to just spend a little
bit of time on because there
02:08:50: are a couple of characters
from history, people that
02:08:52: were in concentration camps.
02:08:53: Nelson Mandela.
02:08:55: I mean, I'm not sure he
had Instagram in there.
02:08:57: I'm pretty sure he didn't.
02:08:58: And I don't think there
was anyone coaching him on,
02:09:01: hey, you're going
to get out someday.
02:09:02: And actually, you're going
to lead an entire country.
02:09:05: I'm pretty sure that's
not how it worked.
02:09:07: He had to find it here.
02:09:08: He had to find it
between his ears.
02:09:10: And there are other examples.
02:09:12: But that's an important one.
02:09:14: So the process of going
inward, does it, for you--
02:09:19: and here, I will
ask for suggestions
02:09:21: because I think people want--
02:09:22: there are those of us who
want to build this skill.
02:09:27: Wall yourself off.
02:09:29: Phone off for big portions
of the day, perhaps.
02:09:34: Texting off.
02:09:36: The requests, the
this, the that.
02:09:40: Anyone that knows you
knows that-- we've
02:09:42: communicated a few
texts, but most of it
02:09:44: comes through a filter.
02:09:45: She's great.
02:09:46: She knows you.
02:09:47: And she knows how to
protect your time.
02:09:49: DAVID GOGGINS: And that
hurts people's feelings.
02:09:50: People get mad about that.
02:09:51: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Hey, God bless--
02:09:52: God bless you, Jennifer.
02:09:58: Cutting oneself off,
when you're in there,
02:10:01: you say it's just you.
02:10:05: And the voices that come
up are not pleasant.
02:10:10: And then at some point,
it converts to action.
02:10:14: OK.
02:10:17: What is the process
of picking the action?
02:10:19: That's the piece that
I feel like there's,
02:10:21: like, a bridge to build here,
if you can, if you would.
02:10:25: DAVID GOGGINS: So the action
being, like, what's next?
02:10:27: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, so when you
02:10:29: go to sleep at night,
when that happens,
02:10:32: you know what you're
going to do the next day?
02:10:34: It's pre-planned?
02:10:34: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
02:10:35: ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
02:10:35: DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.
02:10:36: It's always the same thing.
02:10:37: ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're
not building it on the fly.
02:10:39: DAVID GOGGINS: No.
02:10:39: Nothing's on the fly.
02:10:41: So how it works
internally for me is I'll
02:10:45: put it exactly how it is.
02:10:47: I'm an artist.
02:10:49: And every day, I'm
painting Mona Lisa.
02:10:54: Every day.
02:10:55: And but it's a different one.
02:10:56: It's not the same painting.
02:10:58: So every day I wake up, even
though I'll do the same thing,
02:11:00: it takes a different
way to get there.
02:11:02: So every day, in my mind,
I'm going through my mind.
02:11:04: I'm just like-- and a good
painter will not just paint.
02:11:11: He needs to create.
02:11:12: And you can't create with
phones and everything
02:11:15: going around you.
02:11:16: So you got to
block yourself off.
02:11:18: You only do two
podcasts in a year.
02:11:21: You block yourself off.
02:11:22: And you're painting
this thing inside.
02:11:25: And you're going through
all these different colors
02:11:27: of paint and everything else.
02:11:29: And you can only figure
out the right painting
02:11:32: if you spend the correct
amount of time in your brain.
02:11:35: So every single
day, I'm literally
02:11:37: going through my mind,
and I'm painting.
02:11:39: I'm creating this masterpiece.
02:11:42: And the masterpiece
is always myself.
02:11:44: And but to do that, you
cannot have any distractions
02:11:48: because if you're talking to an
artist and he's trying to think
02:11:51: about the next
painting, he can't.
02:11:54: It's impossible to
listen to you and listen
02:11:57: to what your mind and body
are telling you we must do.
02:12:01: Because people
don't do enough of.
02:12:02: They don't do any of it.
02:12:05: They don't have passion.
02:12:06: They lack passion,
drive, determination
02:12:08: because you haven't
spent time with yourself.
02:12:11: Your mind will tell
you what is next.
02:12:14: But you haven't
spent the time to go,
02:12:18: all right, let me
just figure this out.
02:12:23: You're looking for let me Google
this, and let me Google that,
02:12:27: and let me-- you're not
going to find it there
02:12:29: because there's billions
of people in this world.
02:12:35: And they're all supposed
to be individuals.
02:12:39: But we have a pack mentality.
02:12:42: That's why you're
so fucking lost.
02:12:44: Why am I so unique?
02:12:48: I'm being exactly what the
fuck I was supposed to be.
02:12:50: I ain't follow shit.
02:12:52: And when I did follow shit,
I was like everybody else.
02:12:55: The second I said, OK, man, hang
on, dude, you don't like this,
02:12:59: you don't like this, you
don't like this, who are you,
02:13:03: David Goggins?
02:13:04: Who are you supposed to be?
02:13:07: Miraculously, all
these things just--
02:13:10: I couldn't even-- the list of
shit I had to do, just, wham.
02:13:15: It's like, fuck.
02:13:16: OK.
02:13:17: Wow.
02:13:18: Once you sit down with
yourself and say, OK, I
02:13:19: don't want to be like
Michael Jordan or Jim Brown--
02:13:22: they're both born
on my birthday.
02:13:23: So I looked at their birthday.
02:13:24: I said, oh, maybe I
can be one of the--
02:13:26: I can't.
02:13:27: I'm going to be David
fucking Goggins.
02:13:31: And that looks like this.
02:13:34: It just came.
02:13:36: Everything flooded.
02:13:37: So every single day
of my life, there's
02:13:41: a different thing that
comes up that I have to do.
02:13:44: But no one knows what to do
because everybody else is
02:13:46: following steps.
02:13:49: Like the Republican
and Democratic parties.
02:13:51: I'm not political--
02:13:52: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I.
02:13:53: DAVID GOGGINS: --at
all for this reason.
02:13:55: Republicans are going
to vote Republican.
02:13:59: Democrats are going
to vote Democrat.
02:14:02: You're not even a human
fucking being, bro.
02:14:05: No way all you fuckers agree
with all the same fucking shit.
02:14:09: And I know I don't.
02:14:10: So once you figure out
yourself and who you are,
02:14:14: all the answers come.
02:14:16: So every night, a different
painting is being painted.
02:14:20: And it's a beautiful
painting for myself.
02:14:22: I'm like, OK.
02:14:23: That's it.
02:14:23: It may look the same
to most motherfuckers.
02:14:26: But the end result is
very fucking different.
02:14:29: That's why my-- if you look
at what I've done in 49 years,
02:14:34: it's more than most people
will ever do in their life
02:14:36: because they were
a race car driver.
02:14:39: And that's what they did.
02:14:41: They drove a fucking car.
02:14:42: It's great.
02:14:45: I was all kind of shit
because that's exactly what
02:14:49: the painting was saying to do.
02:14:50: It's what the mind
was saying to do.
02:14:52: Wasn't saying just drive a car,
so then that race car driver
02:14:54: didn't know what the fuck to do.
02:14:55: He retires from being a race
car driver, and they're lost.
02:14:59: People go, how are you still--
02:15:01: I don't get it.
02:15:03: Dude, you're never
going to fill your list.
02:15:06: But you never found your
list because it never
02:15:09: was presented in front of
you because your head was
02:15:11: cluttered with shit because
you never just stopped
02:15:15: for lots of minutes, lots
of years, and just said,
02:15:20: all right, it's me and you.
02:15:22: Let it go.
02:15:23: And it just-- bam.
02:15:25: It's right there.
02:15:26: It's right there.
02:15:27: ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
not a psychologist,
02:15:29: as I mentioned before.
02:15:32: But I'm going to venture
a hypothesis here.
02:15:37: I think that you've mastered the
process of internal dialogue.
02:15:44: But when I say dialogue, I
think most people think, oh,
02:15:47: the inner voice, the chatter.
02:15:50: But that's just one
half of a dialogue.
02:15:52: A dialogue is a two-way street.
02:15:55: So I completely agree because
I know from experience
02:15:59: that when we go inward,
oftentimes, we hear things,
02:16:01: if we're really honest with
ourselves, it's like, oh no,
02:16:03: I don't want to
think about that.
02:16:05: No.
02:16:05: And then we start
looking outward.
02:16:07: Or we start trying to shift
our attention or distract.
02:16:11: And there are a
million reasons that
02:16:13: are handed to us, excuses, and
seemingly good justifications
02:16:17: to be able to do that.
02:16:19: But dialogue is
a two-way street.
02:16:21: And it hit me
while you were just
02:16:22: saying what you
were saying, I was
02:16:24: paying very close attention.
02:16:25: And I realized David Goggins
is talking about the voice that
02:16:31: comes up, including the
terrible stuff that no one wants
02:16:34: to hear about themselves
from themselves.
02:16:36: But then he's also got
the dialogue down where
02:16:39: he knows the counter voice.
02:16:41: He goes, yeah, you're right.
02:16:42: And so I'm going to do this.
02:16:43: Or maybe no, remember this.
02:16:47: You're in a dialogue, a
two-way dialogue in there, not
02:16:51: a one-way chatter dialogue.
02:16:53: There are books written
by famous psychologists
02:16:55: about chatter, trying to
shift your internal narrative.
02:16:58: You're like, bring
the internal--
02:17:00: the internal narrative, that's
what going inward is about.
02:17:03: But it's not one voice.
02:17:05: Again, there's a hypothesis.
02:17:06: And I'm not claiming
to be all-knowing.
02:17:07: Lord knows I'm not all-knowing.
02:17:10: But you've mastered
the dialogue.
02:17:12: And if there are three voices,
strong, medium, and weak,
02:17:16: in there, you're like,
let's all come to the table.
02:17:19: So you've got a symphony
of voices in there
02:17:22: that are all you, that
you know to be you.
02:17:24: And you know how to have
those convers-- you're not
02:17:27: afraid to be in
those conversations.
02:17:28: And then you know what the
outcome of that committee
02:17:32: decision is, and you put
it into real-world action.
02:17:35: And the world only
sees the action.
02:17:37: DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.
02:17:38: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And only you can
02:17:40: know your internal dialogue.
02:17:42: And only I can know
my internal dialogue.
02:17:44: And the only way to,
quote unquote, "know it"
02:17:46: is to spend a hell
a lot of time there.
02:17:48: DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.
02:17:49: ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
02:17:50: DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.
02:17:51: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
02:17:51: DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.
02:17:52: Like, think about it.
02:17:55: For me to be sitting
here in front of you,
02:17:58: you're not going to
call 300-pound Ecolab
02:18:01: guy to come sit here.
02:18:03: You might.
02:18:03: I don't know.
02:18:04: Maybe.
02:18:04: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.
02:18:05: DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not.
02:18:06: Think about this.
02:18:09: What we teach people is
kind, kindness to yourself.
02:18:16: Do you think if I
taught myself kindness--
02:18:19: and I agree with it.
02:18:20: God, so many people-- so many
people take me out of context,
02:18:22: it's ridiculous.
02:18:24: Take it however the fuck
you want to take it.
02:18:26: When I was 300
pounds, where do you
02:18:30: think that conversation
would that got me
02:18:32: if I spoke kindness to myself?
02:18:33: I'll tell you where it gets me.
02:18:35: Right back to 7-Eleven with
another box of mini chocolate
02:18:38: donuts and a
chocolate milkshake.
02:18:41: That's the one voice.
02:18:44: That's the one voice
that most of us have
02:18:47: that you're talking about.
02:18:48: If you don't have a conversation
in there, the other voice
02:18:51: that you create that says,
OK, how does this look?
02:18:56: Looks very ugly.
02:18:58: That kind conversation for
me went away a long time ago,
02:19:02: which is why the dialogue
is now what you see.
02:19:05: A lot of action.
02:19:07: Because most people have
inaction because there's
02:19:11: one person talking.
02:19:12: And that one person
is always leading you
02:19:14: down the same
path, the path that
02:19:16: makes you feel very comfortable
and happy with yourself.
02:19:22: The second you create the
other voice, there's conflict.
02:19:25: Just battles.
02:19:26: Just wars.
02:19:28: Just defeat.
02:19:30: One thing I learned, and
I taught myself this,
02:19:32: and people go, I don't
understand what you're saying,
02:19:34: I'm going to try to
break it down real quick.
02:19:37: I didn't teach
myself victory first.
02:19:41: I taught myself failure.
02:19:43: I taught myself how to fail.
02:19:47: And people like,
that's so depressing.
02:19:50: Is it?
02:19:50: When you're 300 pounds and
you can't read and write
02:19:53: and you're fucked up,
you know how many times
02:19:55: you're going to fucking
fail on that process?
02:19:58: So if you don't know how to
fail, there is no victory.
02:20:02: I never talked about
winning because I
02:20:04: knew the path to
winning was going
02:20:08: to be years of failing first.
02:20:10: So I taught myself
how to fail properly.
02:20:14: No one teaches you
how to fucking fail.
02:20:18: But if you're going out
for insurmountable fucking
02:20:21: odds that make absolutely
no fucking sense,
02:20:24: a Black kid that can't
swim, 300 pounds--
02:20:26: going to be a Navy SEAL.
02:20:28: OK.
02:20:31: You better teach yourself
how to fail first
02:20:34: because if you sit in
failure for too long,
02:20:38: you will never come out of it.
02:20:40: So the first part
of my success was
02:20:45: learning how to fail properly.
02:20:48: And then eventually, I started
getting a few victories.
02:20:53: But that's what
people don't get.
02:20:55: When you have buried yourself
in such a deep fucking hole,
02:20:59: you better first talk
about the failures
02:21:01: you're going to have first.
02:21:01: And that's when that
other voice comes up.
02:21:03: It tells you, we've
got to do something.
02:21:04: But it also tells
you, boy, I'm not
02:21:07: going to lie to you, Goggins.
02:21:09: You're in for a
fucking climb, bro.
02:21:12: You're going to get
your ass handed to you,
02:21:14: made fun of, the outside
noise, the inside noise.
02:21:18: Both voices are going
to be fucking telling
02:21:20: you to go fuck yourself.
02:21:22: You are in for hell, bro.
02:21:26: I am.
02:21:27: So I better learn to fail.
02:21:28: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So this is what you
02:21:30: mean when you say that
whatever anyone says,
02:21:32: it's insignificant?
02:21:33: DAVID GOGGINS:
Insignificant as fuck.
02:21:34: ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's the cap gun fire
02:21:36: because it's just like
it-- because the voice
02:21:38: in your own head is far worse.
02:21:40: And I should say, sorry, one
of the voices in your head.
02:21:44: I'm being very detailed,
almost surgical
02:21:46: about that because I think
this thing about inner dialogue
02:21:49: we think is one voice.
02:21:50: But you're making it
clear it's many voices.
02:21:53: DAVID GOGGINS: It is.
02:21:54: And the thing about it is,
you have to be really--
02:21:59: and sometimes all the
voices are telling you
02:22:01: the wrong shit, man.
02:22:03: But through years, years, not a
podcast or listening to a book
02:22:08: or reading a book,
years of sacrifice,
02:22:12: of suffering, of diligent
pinpoint fucking work
02:22:16: on what you want
to do for yourself,
02:22:18: not like, oh, let me
just do a bunch of shit.
02:22:23: Let me-- I want to be
in every task possible.
02:22:27: No.
02:22:28: Pinpoint what I want
to do with my life.
02:22:33: What happens is you have
all these voices that
02:22:36: are telling you
you're fucked up,
02:22:38: and this is going to be hard.
02:22:39: But for some reason, you put
so much practice into you
02:22:44: that you can ignore
every one of them that
02:22:47: are telling you you're not
going to fucking make it.
02:22:50: And still be able
to fucking make it
02:22:53: because you have put
the practice in that you
02:22:56: know this is the process.
02:22:59: It's such a daunting task that
all the voices are saying no.
02:23:04: But you still have
the conviction
02:23:06: that I know I can do this.
02:23:08: And that's what it took
for me to get here.
02:23:13: 20, 30 years ago, I had this--
02:23:15: 35 or whatever it was,
25 years ago, pipe dream.
02:23:21: And ever since then, every voice
was like, you're a fucking nut.
02:23:27: But when you put that practice
in every day, you lace them up.
02:23:30: And I mean, run.
02:23:32: It's just a metaphor for life.
02:23:34: When you lace them
motherfuckers up every day,
02:23:36: pretty soon, you win.
02:23:38: Pretty soon, you'll fucking win.
02:23:40: If you have the courage and
the heart and the dedication
02:23:42: and the mindset of everybody
can go fuck themselves,
02:23:45: I know what I know.
02:23:46: I've listened to
myself enough to know.
02:23:49: I know what I know.
02:23:51: None of you can hear
what I'm hearing.
02:23:53: And that's what people
don't do enough of.
02:23:55: They don't listen
to their journey.
02:23:58: They listen to
everybody else's shit.
02:24:00: Before you know it, I'm crazy.
02:24:02: But if I'm so fucking crazy,
why am I so successful?
02:24:06: How that happen?
02:24:09: But I'm so misguided
and fucked up.
02:24:13: And don't listen to him.
02:24:17: Why am I the only one to
do a whole bunch of shit?
02:24:20: Why am I a trailblazer?
02:24:23: Why?
02:24:23: How is that possible?
02:24:24: How can you be fucked up and
also self-made at the same
02:24:28: fucking--
02:24:29: no.
02:24:29: No.
02:24:30: Obviously, you're not looking
at the truth in front of you.
02:24:34: The truth in front
of you is it sucks.
02:24:37: It's painful.
02:24:39: It's fucking mind-numbing.
02:24:41: And that is the truth.
02:24:44: And that's why a
lot of people don't
02:24:46: like listening to me because
this is what it takes,
02:24:49: creating another voice and
sometimes going at it alone.
02:24:53: All the time going at it
alone because no one's
02:24:55: going to believe in you.
02:24:57: And that's that.
02:24:59: ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm
about to say is not conjecture.
02:25:01: And I can say that
with confidence
02:25:04: because I did a
four-episode guest
02:25:05: series with a brilliant
psychiatrist, a guy named
02:25:08: Paul Conti.
02:25:09: He's from Trenton.
02:25:10: He's a Stanford,
Harvard-trained guy.
02:25:12: He's also got a lot
of street in him.
02:25:13: He's had his own
hardship, real hardship.
02:25:16: He's brilliant.
02:25:17: And he said something
that I'll never forget,
02:25:20: which is, we think that
the forebrain, the part
02:25:22: of our brain that creates
strategy, et cetera,
02:25:25: is the supercomputer.
02:25:26: He said, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.
02:25:28: No, no, no.
02:25:29: He's like, the
supercomputer of the brain
02:25:31: is the unconscious mind.
02:25:33: It's the part of our mind that's
controlling most everything.
02:25:38: And most people,
unfortunately, don't
02:25:40: do the work to understand
how their unconscious is
02:25:42: controlling them.
02:25:43: And that's a scary
thing, this idea,
02:25:45: like your mind is
controlling you.
02:25:47: And I'm not going to get
into the free will debate.
02:25:49: I believe in at least some will.
02:25:53: I believe what you're describing
and this internal dialogue,
02:25:59: I think you have access
to your unconscious mind
02:26:02: by listening to the
dialogue, going inward.
02:26:04: We know this is true in sleep,
in dreams, in meditation,
02:26:07: and just by shutting out
everything else, shutting out
02:26:10: all the external
noise, which is filled
02:26:13: with things that pull us to it.
02:26:14: Noise makes it sound bad, but
it's the gravitational pull
02:26:16: of all the things that allow
us to distract ourselves
02:26:19: without knowing.
02:26:22: The ice cream.
02:26:23: The have a cookie.
02:26:24: The Merry Christmas.
02:26:26: The unconscious
mind, this huge piece
02:26:28: of the iceberg underneath that
Paul calls the supercomputer,
02:26:32: he's saying that with
knowledge as a neurobiologist,
02:26:35: psychiatrist, psychologist,
so he really knows,
02:26:37: that's the piece that if
one does real introspection,
02:26:41: he calls it the cupboards.
02:26:42: You got to look
in the cupboards.
02:26:43: And it's often really scary
what you find in there.
02:26:45: And most people are
just like, I don't even
02:26:47: want to know the
cupboards are there.
02:26:48: But you're pulling all
the cupboard doors open.
02:26:52: And then you're-- and you're
extremely deliberate with what
02:26:55: gets put into action.
02:26:58: You're not just going,
oh, like, I'm pissed,
02:26:59: so I'm going to act pissed.
02:27:01: Or I'm tired, so I'm
going to act tired.
02:27:03: It's you're picking very
carefully what to do.
02:27:07: And that's a process that
I'm guessing came to you.
02:27:11: Does it come to you
as a, OK, it makes
02:27:13: sense why running makes sense.
02:27:15: It makes sense why
smokejumping makes sense.
02:27:20: So it seems like a huge
portion of your time
02:27:25: is spent understanding yourself
and making sense to you.
02:27:30: And so when people
don't understand you,
02:27:32: it's got to be extra frustrating
because most people don't
02:27:34: understand themselves.
02:27:35: So then we're all running
around going, you're this,
02:27:37: and you're that because
most people are just
02:27:39: unwilling to look inward.
02:27:40: And I'm including
myself, by the way.
02:27:42: I mean, I've done a fair
amount of introspection.
02:27:44: But I'm inspired today, that
word, inspired, but it's true,
02:27:47: motivated to start going inward
further because it is scary.
02:27:53: It's like, we don't know
what's in those cupboards,
02:27:55: and it's terrifying, especially
because we don't know.
02:27:59: DAVID GOGGINS: And those are
the first ones to open up.
02:28:01: And like you talked
about, you got
02:28:02: to go through those cupboards.
02:28:03: I do spring cleaning
every fucking
02:28:05: day in those dark cupboards.
02:28:08: Those dark cabinets are the
ones I start with first.
02:28:10: That's the real me, man.
02:28:13: That's the real me.
02:28:13: That's why I'm not ashamed.
02:28:16: I don't hide.
02:28:17: I used to hide.
02:28:19: I don't hide anymore.
02:28:20: He's exactly right.
02:28:21: I don't know all the
fucking science behind shit.
02:28:24: I know what I know.
02:28:26: That's why I don't listen
to anybody anymore.
02:28:28: I don't listen to shit.
02:28:28: I think most people are
full of shit because I know.
02:28:31: I know the deep, dark secrets
of those fucking cupboards.
02:28:35: It's ugly, man.
02:28:36: And every day, I'm
talking to them.
02:28:38: Every day, I'm cleaning them.
02:28:39: I'm cleaning them,
and I'm talking
02:28:40: to the same demons that came
out of those fucking cupboards
02:28:42: as I'm cleaning them.
02:28:43: Sometimes they go right
back in them again.
02:28:46: It's not easy.
02:28:48: And this is why
most of us just--
02:28:52: why I am misunderstood
because what comes out
02:28:56: of those cabinets
that I'm cleaning,
02:28:59: sometimes they see on Instagram.
02:29:01: Sometimes they'll
see it in a podcast.
02:29:03: Sometimes they see
it in this one.
02:29:04: I turn people off.
02:29:05: Open up your own cabinets.
02:29:10: And then go talk about it.
02:29:13: Let me see how pretty it looks.
02:29:15: Let me see how pretty you sound.
02:29:17: Let me see how put
together your words are.
02:29:20: I bet you a fuck or a
motherfucker comes out
02:29:22: because for you to go
back in there again
02:29:24: to clean the same fucking
cabinet that the demon came out
02:29:27: of takes some big balls, bro.
02:29:30: To do it every day of your life.
02:29:33: To go back in there and spring
clean every day, not once
02:29:38: a fucking year,
once every decade.
02:29:41: Every day you know
it gets dusty.
02:29:43: And every day, you don't
start with the victories.
02:29:47: You don't go, oh, this is nice.
02:29:49: Look at my-- look at
my I love me wall.
02:29:51: Let me clean up.
02:29:51: This is a little dusty.
02:29:52: No.
02:29:53: I go right for the things that
are going to keep me buried.
02:29:56: And I go right there first
because if I don't clean those
02:29:58: out first, the
day doesn't start.
02:30:01: So what are you
saying to me is truth.
02:30:06: And like I told you
many times today, I
02:30:09: can never figure out how to
explain this shit to people
02:30:13: because I'm not neuro nothing.
02:30:16: I'm just a guy that said, OK,
we got to start in the dungeon.
02:30:21: And we got to stay here
for the rest of our lives.
02:30:25: For you to become
successful, the dungeon
02:30:27: is a place that has to be clean.
02:30:30: And it's the
scariest place to be.
02:30:33: That's why I'm
misunderstood because I'm
02:30:35: speaking from the dungeon.
02:30:37: That's why I am
successful because I
02:30:40: go there every damn day.
02:30:41: And that is the
truth, what he says.
02:30:44: It's the exact truth.
02:30:46: Those cabinets are
fucking dusty, dirty,
02:30:49: and scary as shit.
02:30:51: Broken glass, fucking
dark, spiders, cobwebs.
02:30:58: But most of all,
your biggest fears,
02:31:01: the biggest things that put
you in a fucked up place you
02:31:04: are today are in there.
02:31:05: That's why we all like
to keep them shut.
02:31:07: You like to lock them up.
02:31:08: Act like they never happened.
02:31:09: That's why you never grow.
02:31:11: You never improve.
02:31:13: You never have
real conversations
02:31:14: like we're having right now.
02:31:15: Never.
02:31:16: Never.
02:31:17: Oh no.
02:31:18: No, no, no, no, no.
02:31:19: Let's not-- no, no, no.
02:31:20: Let's not go there.
02:31:21: I talked to so many
people who tell me that.
02:31:24: Let's talk about this.
02:31:27: Because they'll tell me, but
they can only say it once.
02:31:31: And they'll say it in passing.
02:31:32: They won't get deep
in the weeds with it.
02:31:34: Like, you can't just clean it.
02:31:37: Motherfucker, you got to
spit shine that motherfucker.
02:31:40: You got to relive it,
every fucking detail of it.
02:31:45: You can't just be like, oh
yeah, yeah, my dad beat me.
02:31:47: And it is what it is.
02:31:51: It ain't is what it
is, motherfucker.
02:31:52: It's killing you.
02:31:54: It's taken over your
whole fucking life.
02:31:57: But that's the conversation.
02:31:58: Yeah, my dad beat-- but
I'm fine now, though.
02:32:00: I'm good.
02:32:01: OK.
02:32:03: All right.
02:32:04: No, you ain't.
02:32:04: You ain't fine.
02:32:06: You ain't fine.
02:32:07: This is real talk.
02:32:08: People don't have that.
02:32:09: So your boy's right.
02:32:11: 100% right.
02:32:12: Scary as shit.
02:32:14: It's scary as shit.
02:32:16: But it makes you who
you're supposed to be.
02:32:20: And that's the test.
02:32:22: We forget.
02:32:23: We think we're supposed to
breathe air and have kids
02:32:26: and pay the bills and shit.
02:32:29: But what's this life about?
02:32:31: That makes no sense.
02:32:34: We're being tested, my friend.
02:32:36: Tests come when you
have not studied.
02:32:41: Tests come when you think
that you're in a great place.
02:32:45: That's the test.
02:32:46: The test is every
day of your life.
02:32:48: And most of us fail
because we don't
02:32:50: know why we're here because
we don't go inward to say, oh.
02:32:54: You gave me a lot
of shit to fix, man.
02:32:57: And this test sucks.
02:33:00: But then you start.
02:33:03: ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins.
02:33:07: I don't think I
could add to that.
02:33:08: I know I can't.
02:33:12: Thank you for sharing
what you shared today.
02:33:17: I mean, as much as your
process or anyone's process
02:33:22: can't be completely
understood from the outside,
02:33:28: you gave us a real
window into this thing,
02:33:31: this process that you--
02:33:35: as you said, God put it on you.
02:33:37: I believe in God too.
02:33:38: People can believe
what they want.
02:33:39: But somehow, your life, God gave
you these challenges early on.
02:33:45: And then there was a point
where you went internal.
02:33:50: And like you said,
you developed a skill.
02:33:53: But it's a perishable skill.
02:33:55: And you clearly
live in the process
02:33:58: of opening those cupboards,
reopening those cupboards,
02:34:02: trying to spit shine
those cupboards,
02:34:04: understanding that they're
never, ever really done,
02:34:08: but that you can gain ground
on them, that you can win day
02:34:12: after day after day.
02:34:14: And you really shared a
lot of concrete things
02:34:16: that I know people
are going to be
02:34:21: able to apply if they choose.
02:34:23: And I agree with you.
02:34:23: I think most people
will be like, whoa.
02:34:26: That was a lot.
02:34:28: It's heavy.
02:34:28: I think I want to just kind of
bake myself in Netflix and Chex
02:34:34: Mix instead.
02:34:37: But there's also the
reality that there
02:34:40: are men and women, boys and
girls who hear that and go, OK,
02:34:46: and start cracking
the cupboards open.
02:34:49: And I just know
that for myself, I'm
02:34:52: extremely grateful that
you're willing to put it
02:34:54: all out there.
02:34:55: You're so brutally honest,
so brutally authentic.
02:35:00: That word authenticity
gets thrown around so much.
02:35:03: And I can tell you that for me
and for everybody else, that's
02:35:07: really what resonates.
02:35:09: So whether or not you want
to, whether or not it's
02:35:11: the purpose behind it or not,
you're lighting the path.
02:35:15: So thank you.
02:35:17: DAVID GOGGINS:

02:36:04: of the Huberman Lab podcast,
we discuss supplements.
02:36:07: While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

benefit from them for things
02:36:12: like improving sleep, for
hormone support, and for focus.
