ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to the Huberman Lab podcast

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for everyday life.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of neurobiology
and ophthalmology

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My guest today is David Goggins.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
David Goggins is a
retired Navy SEAL who

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He's also a highly accomplished
ultramarathon runner.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For those of you
that don't know,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
ultramarathons are
distances longer

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
than 26 miles and, in
David's case, often longer

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
than 200 miles.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For his achievements
in athletics,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
he has been inducted into
the International Sports

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Hall of Fame.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He also held a Guinness World
Record for the most pull-ups

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
completed in 24 hours.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I should mention that not only
was David a decorated Navy

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
SEAL, but he also graduated
from Army Ranger School.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
David is also a highly
successful writer,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
having authored two books, the
first entitled "Can't Hurt Me"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the second entitled "Never
Finished," both of which

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are best sellers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
David's books cover
many topics, including

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
his autobiographical
description of what can only

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
be described as an
incredibly challenging child

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and young adulthood.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
His home was abusive.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
His school environment
was abusive.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He essentially had no positive
resources directed his way and.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In his 20s, he found himself
to be obese, that is,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
more than 300
pounds working a job

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
he despised for minimal pay.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And it was at that point that
David began an inner dialogue

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that forced him to explore
the demons born out

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of his childhood but also the
position that he found himself

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in as a young man and
then began the journey

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to navigate that dialogue and
transform himself into the Navy

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
SEAL, the ultramarathon
runner, the bestselling author,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the extraordinarily
positive and influential man

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that he is today.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
As some of you may
know, David has

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
done various public lectures.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He's a familiar face
online because there are so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
many clips of him on YouTube.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And he has done podcasts before.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
However, I'm certain that
you'll find today's discussion

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to be very different
than previous podcasts

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that David has been featured on.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The reason is
that-- of course, we

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
get into his accomplishments.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We talk about the
mindset that allowed

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
him to achieve those things.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But, today, David really
lets us under the hood.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
He lets us into the
form of inner dialogue

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that he has to
embrace, indeed that he

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
has to grapple with on a daily
basis, sometimes multiple times

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
throughout the day
and night in order

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to impose the sort
of self-discipline

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that he is so well known for.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We also get into some of
the scientific mechanisms

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
underlying willpower.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And we talk about
David's current endeavors

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that include, for instance,
his own exploration of science

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and medicine for which he
has become an intense scholar

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and practitioner.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I should mention that multiple
times throughout today's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
discussion you will
hear curse words.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now David and I both
acknowledge that cursing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
isn't for everybody
and that cursing

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
itself is different than
cursing at somebody.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Nonetheless, we do realize
that many people, parents

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
perhaps especially, might
not want to hear cursing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
If you don't want
to hear cursing,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
well, then this podcast episode
is probably not for you.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
However, if you are
comfortable with cursing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
or if you can tolerate
it, I assure you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
today's discussion
is highly worthwhile.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
roles at Stanford.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to bring zero cost to
consumer information

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about science and
science-related tools

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to the general public.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In keeping with
that theme, I'd like

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Our first sponsor
is Maui Nui Venison.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Maui Nui Venison is the most
nutrient dense and delicious

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
red meat available.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I've spoken before
on this podcast

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and there's general consensus
that most people should strive

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to consume approximately
1 gram of protein

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
per pound of body weight.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now when one strives
to do that, it's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
important to maximize the
quality of that protein intake

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to the calorie ratio
because you don't

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
want to consume an
excess of calories

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
when trying to get
that 1 gram of protein

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
per pound of body weight.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Maui Nui Venison has an
extremely high quality protein

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to calorie ratio.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So it makes getting that 1
gram of protein per pound

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of body weight extremely easy.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's also delicious.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Personally, I like
the ground venison.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I also like the venison steaks.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And then for convenience
when I'm on the road,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I like the jerky.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The jerky has a very high
protein to calorie ratio.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So it has as much as 10 grams
of protein per jerky stick,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and it has something
like only 55 calories,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so, again, making
it very easy to get

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
enough protein without
consuming excess calories.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Today's episode is also
brought to us by AeroPress.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
AeroPress is similar to a
French press for making coffee,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but it is, in fact, a much
better way to make coffee.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I first learned about AeroPress
well over 10 years ago.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And I've been using
one ever since.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
AeroPress was developed
by Alan Adler, who

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
was an engineer at Stanford.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I knew of Alan
because he had also

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
built the so-called Aerobie
Frisbee, which I believe

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
at one time, perhaps
still now, held

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the Guinness Book
of World Records

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
for furthest thrown object.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And I used to see Alan,
believe it or not,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
at parks around Palo Alto
testing out different Aerobie

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Frisbees.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So he was sort of
famous in our community

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for developing these
different feats of engineering

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that turned into
commercial products.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now I love coffee.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm somebody that drinks coffee
nearly every day, usually

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
about 90 to 120
minutes after I wake up

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in the morning,
although not always.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Sometimes if I'm
going to exercise,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'll drink coffee first
thing in the morning.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But I love, love, love coffee.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And what I've personally found
is that by using the AeroPress,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I can make the best possible
tasting cup of coffee.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I don't know what exactly
it is in the AeroPress that

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
allows the same
beans to be prepared

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
into a cup of coffee that tastes
that much better as compared

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to any other form of
brewing that coffee, even

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the traditional French press.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The AeroPress is
extremely easy to use.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And it's extremely compact.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
In fact, I take it with
me whenever I travel.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And I use it on the road,
in hotels, even on planes.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I'll just ask for
some hot water,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and I'll brew my coffee or
tea right there on the plane.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
If you'd like to try
AeroPress, you can go

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and sleep tracking capacity.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I've spoken many times
before on this podcast

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
about the fact that
sleep is the foundation

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of mental health, physical
health, and performance.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Now a key component of
getting a great night's sleep

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
is that in order to fall
and stay deeply asleep,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
your body temperature
actually has

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And in order to wake up feeling
refreshed and energized,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
your body temperature
actually has

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to increase by about
1 to 3 degrees.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
One of the best ways to make
sure that those temperature

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
changes occur at the appropriate
times, at the beginning

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and throughout and at the end
of your night when you wake up,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
is to control the temperature
of your sleeping environment.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And that's what Eight
Sleep allows you to do.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It allows you to program the
temperature of your mattress

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and sleeping environment
such that you fall

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and stay deeply asleep
easily and wake up

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
each morning feeling incredibly
refreshed and energized.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I've been sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
cover for almost
three years now.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And it has dramatically improved
the quality of my sleep.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000

Again, that's

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And now for my discussion
with David Goggins.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
David Goggins, welcome.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
DAVID GOGGINS: My man.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Good to see you again, man.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Great to see you.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It was late 2016,
early 2017, I believe,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
when you were in
my lab at Stanford.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a
little work later that day

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
down in San Jose.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And, gosh, see you everywhere,
but it's not enough.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So great to have you here.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Thanks for
having me on, brother.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
You embody discipline
and doing hard things.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I think we should just
start right off with--

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Let's just go there.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--the bold truth.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But right before
we went hot mics,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
we were talking about learning.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Right now, you're spending some
time learning and doing things

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that I think most people
probably don't typically

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
associate David Goggins with.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don't
you tell us about that?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Well,
most people just

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
look at me as the guy that
runs and yells as he's running.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
While I do that to
motivate people,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but people don't understand
that my day is broken up

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
into segments.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I work out.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I eat.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I sleep, but I spend
most of my time studying.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So like I'm in
the medical world.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I'm a paramedic in Canada.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
But I spend a lot
of my time trying

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to nuke every single thing
about it because I'm not

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
trying to just be a
paramedic, learn about veins,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and arteries, and how the heart
pumps, and stuff like that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I'm trying to learn
to the point where

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I can save someone's life.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And even though paramedics are
doing that all over the world,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I'm trying to be that
paramedic that can really

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
dissect exactly what's going on
and figure out what medication

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
goes where, just trying to
learn the algorithm of what's

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
going on, man.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So I spent a lot
of time with it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
love the word algorithm

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because when I teach
biology or try and learn

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
anything that's related
to biology and especially

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the human body, I need
to know the nouns.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But it's the verbs that matter.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And that's really what
you're talking about.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Just saying that sits there,
that brain part there,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
doesn't tell you how
it all works together.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So what does your process
for studying look like?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
If we dropped a
camera in the room,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
brought a microphone into
your inner dialogue--

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
gosh, wouldn't we all love that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But if we dropped a microphone
into your inner dialogue,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
are you waking up looking
at the books and going,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
yeah, fresh day, let's learn or
is some of the same resistance

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that you've talked about
coming up around physical work,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is that coming up
from time to time?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
DAVID GOGGINS: You know
what, I was nervous at first.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I'm going to keep it real.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I'm going to keep it real.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So I'm not a real smart guy.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And what I mean by that is
I was born with ADD, ADHD.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Like my brain cannot
retain information.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I'm not some genetic freak
when it comes to running,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when it comes to
lifting weights.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I am absolutely the
bottom of the barrel.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And people will
never believe me.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And they can just whatever.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Believe what you
want to believe.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So when you ask me this question
about what does studying look

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
like for me, I have to go over
the same page over, and over,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and over, and over again, while
Jennifer can look at that page

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
while she's quizzing me,
she'll learn it right then

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
as she's-- she didn't
know anything about it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
She will quiz herself
or quiz me and learn it

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
as she's quizzing me.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It's the most frustrating
thing in the world

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
how my brain works.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So what I do is I literally
sit there with a pen and paper.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I have my books.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And I go through and
have to write everything

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
down every single day.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I will study the
same page until it's

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
photographic memory from
writing the same thing down.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And then from there, I'll go
back through and relearn it

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
again.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So I'll learn the bulk of it.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But then I'll go through
and learn the small things

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
within that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So if it's a medication, I'll
learn what the medication does.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
First, I'll learn
how to even say

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the medication because
these medications aren't

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
like albuterol.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
No, it's very big words.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So I'll go through, learn
how to say the name.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Then I'll go through
learn what the dose is.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Then I'll go through-- and
this is like every single day.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So it's not like, oh, I got it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Let's just go through--
no, nothing is I got it.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Every single thing--
so I can't wait

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
to get in this conversation
because everything

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I do in life, it sucks.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Everything I do
in life, it sucks.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
That's why when I was 300
pounds and 24 years old,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
it wasn't like I had some
big epiphany of let's just

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
go be a Navy SEAL, and
let's lose some weight.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
No, I knew my entire
life was going

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
to be a struggle, which
is why I just ignored it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And I said, I'm not even trying
to jump off any of this shit

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and learn how to read, how
to write, how to memorize,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
how to become
something I am not.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But through that process,
something happened to me.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And I realized-- this is
why I feel sorry for no one.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
In this podcast, they're
going to really not like me

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
because people
are going to think

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
that I am maybe lying or
maybe fibbing or exaggerating.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
No, I am literally--

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I was the lowest form on Earth,
no talent, no ability to learn.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And I literally know what
it is to be rock bottom

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and to build that up.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So that question about
learning is the pain in my ass.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I don't have to do it.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Just think about it.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I'm 49 years old, and
I'm a multi-millionaire.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I don't have to do anything.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So all I thought about
when I was growing up

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
is, man, I can't wait to
one day get to the point

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
where I no longer
have to do this stuff.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
But what happened
as I got older,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
it became a way of living.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So how I do every day
is how I do every day.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
It's a discipline.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
It's a regimen.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It was a choice I made.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And the choice I made was what
are you willing to sacrifice,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and what are you willing to
give up to find every bit of who

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
you are as a human being?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And I was willing to give
up everything to do that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So studying is no joke.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love
that you're studying.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I recall a few years ago, I
heard some interview or podcast

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.000
with you.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And you just threw out like I
don't know what I'll do next.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Maybe I'll be a scientist.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And I went yeah.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Because I knew-- because
I know you a bit.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And I see your work
out there, but we

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
had met before,
that if you decided

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that you were going to do it--

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and learning medicine,
which is what you're doing,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
learning human physiology
is so detailed.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Very.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And people out there

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
have to understand when
you look at a textbook

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and you see the veins and the
capillaries different colors,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
when the body is open,
they're not different colors.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Right, right, right.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
I mean, some things

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
have different color
contrasts, but it's not

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
like it's all labeled
when you pop it open.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the
process of writing things down

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
by hand is important for you.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So you go back and
read those notes.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Do you think about
that stuff on your runs

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
too or are you
segmenting your day

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
like when you're done studying,
are you heading out for a run

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and thinking about other things?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Or are you still rehearsing
the material in your head?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
DAVID GOGGINS: So when I write
it down, I write it down,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and I'm able to--

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I'm actually looking
down at this table

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
right now because
I'm back to writing.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So I'm actually there right
now as I'm speaking to you.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I write it down in a way
that I'm memorizing page 69.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So I'm writing it down.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So then writing it down and that
page sync together in my brain.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So I'm looking at the book
in my brain right now.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
That's just how it works for me.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And I have to do it
over and over again.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So that page is
stuck in my mind.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So I'm literally
flipping through pages

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as I'm taking these tests.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And I'm taking these national
tests to become a paramedic

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
or become an advanced
EMT or whatever.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I'm literally as I'm taking
that test I'm going through.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I'm like-- now I'm
flipping pages in my head

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
where that page was.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And how I do that is
just from how I write it

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and how it's on the page.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
When I run, I can't
recall any of it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I cannot bring any of
that because I'm running.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
How my mind is wired now is that
everything I do is what I do.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because the focus it takes for
me to-- right now, I'm running.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I'm not like a great runner.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I'm not like injury free.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So like my first 20 minutes
of the run I'm limping.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I'm literally
limping because I've

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
had several knee surgeries.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And my body was twisted.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And so now it's untwisting.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So people look at me, oh, looks,
like he's limping when he runs.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I am limping when I run.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
My body is jacked
up so I'm focusing

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
on how to get the best
out of a broken body.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So everything I do
is a total focus

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
on what I'm doing at
that point in my life.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it
seems like you've really

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
trained away or somehow
gotten away from the ADD

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that you mentioned
because what you described

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
is like a deep trench.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It's like a V shaped trench.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I'm imagining like
there's a ball bearing,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and it's like, phewp, and it can
only go forward in that trench

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
or back.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And it goes forward.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
It's not like sliding around
at the concave at the bottom,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
zip-zip-zip, like a tension.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So it's like you
trained that up.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Is there a similar
feeling when you're

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
in the full focus of running
versus full focus of studying?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Does it kind of
feel like, oh yeah,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that's the same groove but
different thing or is it

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
just completely different world?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's a
completely different world.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Both of them for
me is suffering,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
but it's suffering a
whole different way.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Like when I was going through
school, I never forget--

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I think I was in third grade.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And back then, ADD, ADHD,
wasn't like here's this medicine

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
or here's this thing.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
They want to put you
in a special school.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So for me, I was so
far behind in learning

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
that their big thing
was let's just put him

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
in a special school
because he'll never learn.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And through that
process of like I

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
don't want to be in
a special school,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I don't want to be treated
any differently, it really--

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
like I never took medication.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I've never taken
medication for this.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
That's why right now you see
me looking right in your eyes.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
What the hell is Huberman
saying right now.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And that's why I don't feel
bad for people who have ADHD,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
who have learning disabilities.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And some are impossible
because you just can't.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
But a lot of them you can.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But people don't want to go
through the process of focus,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
of teaching yourself
how to truly focus.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
This is where my
message gets lost.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
It gets lost because I may
say MF or F because that's

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
the passion that
comes out of me.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
It takes everything for
me to learn a sentence.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So when I speak
about David Goggins,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I can't speak about David
Goggins in a way that's

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
just calm and cool.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Because when I wake
up, I know the journey

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
that it takes for me
to find my greatness.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And it's hard.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Nothing is easy.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Nothing just like, oh, I
wake up, and I just do this

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
or I do that or it just--
no, I watch people every day

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
go through life,
and it's so easy.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
For me to be where I'm at
today, it takes every bit of me.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So when I speak about it,
and as I get going here,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
you'll start seeing me--
the tempo will rise.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
The passion will come out
because I'm back there.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I'm doing what I do every
day to become a human being.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And so nothing is easy.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Like running is running.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
It sucks.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
But you have a choice to make.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Do you want to sit down and go
back to that guy you once were?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
No.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So this is what it takes.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
It takes that
misunderstanding of people.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And they'll never get it because
they were never David Goggins.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
So that is what it takes
for me to do what I do.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
It may take you
something differently.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So for me, everything
has to be in the study.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Everything has to be into this.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Everything has to
be in-- everywhere

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I am it has to be there,
me, focused where I am.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
That's why you're
my second podcast

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I've done since Rogan,
since the book came out.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I don't have time for that shit
because if I want to be great,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I'm not trying to maximize money
or maximize people knowing me.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I do these things because
maybe someone out there will

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
understand me and get it and
say, I can grow from this guy,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and others just won't.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds
like friction is something

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
you're very familiar with.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
It's a word just I feel
like is like cast above us

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
right now in bold face,
highlighted, underlined

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.000
letters.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Friction is growth.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction,
like you're up in the morning.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And I imagine David Goggins
going to the coffee maker,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
stretching out, good
morning, sunshine.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And you're telling me from
eyelids open there's friction.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that
is the thing that people

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
don't-- they don't fucking get.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
The biggest misunderstanding
about David Goggins

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
of all time--

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
it's like whether you
believe in God or not--

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I do-- he put this lab rat,
which is me, on this planet

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and said let me fucking
see what a beat up,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
abused kid who can barely
learn, barely learn,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
who has a twisted body, messed
up genetics, sickle cell, this

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and that, let me
give him everything

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
that pretty much disqualifies
you from the military.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But back then, it wasn't as--
and let's put him in this

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
and see what comes out of it.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So to do that, friction--

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
you don't wake up
in the morning time

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
and go to the coffee maker.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Matter of fact, sometimes
you don't even sleep.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
What it requires
is when I'm at--

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
2 o'clock-- it's 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And my brain is thinking
about a fucking drug.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And I got to get up
and look in my book

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
to see what that drug
is, how I remember it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And this is every day
of my fucking life.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
That's why when I train a
fighter or I train someone,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I'm like, you have no fucking
idea how great you really

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
are because you are
using such minimal,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
minimal of what you have.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And if people can learn to
focus, this is what's possible.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
While it may not
be pretty-- like

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
people want to do a
documentary on me.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I go no.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I don't want to do
a documentary on me

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
because I will have normal
everyday people picking me

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
apart.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Oh, his life is miserable.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Who wants to live like that?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
It's crazy how he-- it's
almost like he's sick.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
He's psychotic.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
The most frustrating
thing in the world for me

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
is when normal people
judge a man like myself

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
on what it really takes to
extract greatness from nothing.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
It takes every bit of who you
are if you choose that route.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
If you don't, Merry Christmas,
do what you got to do.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
But, yeah, all these
things for me--

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
like I told you, man, I'm
going to keep it real.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I'm not coming here to talk
about perform without purpose

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
because I go through--

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
when I write these
books, I go through,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I try to dumb down
David Goggins.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
How can I give normal
people-- and I'm normal.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
But I found something that
most don't want to find.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
How can I speak to
people and give them

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
something from this crazy
psychotic brain that I've

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
developed?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
How can I give them that?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
So I sit down with
Jennifer for years

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and write down perform
without purpose,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
callus your mind, armor
your mind, the cookie jar,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
the accountability mirror, shit
that people can fucking use

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
in their lives.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
No, no, I'm glad it helps you.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
But the barbaric life that I
live that you have to live,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
the almost obsession that
you must have to be great,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
you can't put that shit
in a fucking book, bro.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
You can't put in a book.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
You can't.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
You can't write about it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
has to be experienced.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It has
to be experienced.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And you can't even--

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
after you experience it,
to write it in the book,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
it would seem like he
needs to be locked up.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Doesn't make sense for
a guy that everything,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
every second of the
day he is trying

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
to extract more from something.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
He's constantly thinking.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
He's constantly,
constantly disciplined,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
never going off the path.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Whatever is injured on
him, he figures away.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It's a conquerors mindset.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And very few people, if any, can
really understand what that is.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Like I'm almost 50.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And I've been this way
for almost 30 years.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Like what do you do for fun?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
These questions,
I don't get them.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I don't understand them.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I don't-- so yeah.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get
asked that sometimes,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.000
what do you do for fun.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I start listing off all this
stuff like podcasting, reading,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
working out.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
So some of that resonates.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
But I think what's so
truly unusual about what

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
you're describing, your process
is that from go it's hard.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I have to ask was being 300
pounds, having essentially--

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I'm using the words
you've described.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
DAVID GOGGINS: No, do it.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You've said it before.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
You had a tendency at one
point in your life early

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
on tell lies, try and
get people's approval.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy
haircuts, attention seeking,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
and yet all of that
triggered something

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
that now is extraordinary.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Do you think those
hardships were

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
necessary to flip the switch?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I don't know
if they were necessary,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
but it was something
that made me feel--

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I didn't feel good.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It was easy.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
The brain that I was
given as a child,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
it was easy to go
home and think about,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
how do I want to
be a freak today?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
How do I want to show up to
school today and be a freak?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
It didn't require me going home
and opening a book up saying,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
it's going to take me all year
to learn this fucking page.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So instead of
learning that page,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I learned how to
become a character.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And maybe that character
that I created,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
that 300 pound,
insecure guy that

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
used to fake it till
I make it type of guy,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
let me become your
friend, let me lie to you

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
until you like me type of guy--

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
when you have any manhood,
womanhood, a human being,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
a soul, a spirit, any--

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I must have just this much
pride because that's exactly

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
what opened the door for me.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Because every day,
you were a character.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Every day, you were a clown.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Every day, you opened that
Spanish book or that science

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
book or English book,
and you looked at it.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
It looked like a
foreign language.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And you're saying,
where do I start?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Where do I start?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And, obviously,
it was necessary.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
The more I talk about it, it
was necessary because what

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
happened is I became
haunted by the mere fact

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
that this is my existence.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And you got to live with that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And I lived with it
for a lot of years.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And so I sat back and
said, OK, all right,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I know what this takes.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And when you sit back,
as fucked up as I was--

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
and I had a laundry
list, a table

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
like this of what I
have to do to become

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
just a human being that
can make ends meet,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
that can make $1,000 a month.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Just to get there was like,
oh my god, dude, like how--

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
I'm 16, 17, I can't read.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I can't write.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Oh my god, I'm so
behind the power curve.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And my brain is about
being depressed.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And my dad beat--
my mom's not home.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And kids are calling
me nigger at school.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And I'm like, oh my god,
man, what the fuck do I do?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And it wasn't like someone
came around and said,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
hey, man, you can do this.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
This is all me.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Some people want to know where
does this cold man come from.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
I'm not trying to be cold.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It's the reality of my life.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
It's the reality of a
lot of people's lives.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
And so, yeah, that had to
happen for me to be haunted,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
to be haunted, to
pull out, to extract

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
the guy that I am today.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
That haunting is something
that's still there today

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
because no matter
how much you improve,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
no matter how much you
change who you are,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
it's not permanent.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
You don't just wake up
and say, oh my god, man,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
you're David Goggins.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
You break records.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.000
You do this.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
You do that.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
People want to know, how are
you able to just be so hard?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Because I never turn
the fucking thing off.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Because once it turns
off, I go right back

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
to the David Goggins that is.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And that's the guy that I'm
constantly fighting every day.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And it's a choice.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And that choice makes
you misunderstood.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
It makes you crazy.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
That's why I hate
fucking social media.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
In 2013, people wanted
me to write my book.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I did it in 2018.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Took five years.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And the reason why
I didn't do it--

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I sat at the table,
and Jennifer was there.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
This was before she
started working for me,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
I started dating
her or whatever.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And all these people were there.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And they're like, man, you
got to go on social media.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And I was like, fuck you, man.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
It's poison.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
It's poison because I knew
what I did to get where I am.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And I'm going to
have these people,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
these normal, everyday
people, fat, lazy,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
exactly who I was judging me.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Because I know it
because I was once them.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
All my hard work,
all my dedication,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I'm going to have
some normal dude get

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
his little brownie, his little
Ding Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
sit there with his
coffee picking me apart.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Oh, he must be unhappy.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Do you know how hard it
is to put these shoes

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
on every damn morning?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
And I'm gonna have
you pick me apart?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
So, yeah, there's so
much that goes into this

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
that I was like fuck this.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I never wanted
anything to do with it.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
So anyway.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
not a psychologist.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
But knowing your story
from what you've written,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
what you've said
on social media,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
and elsewhere, podcasts and
here now especially, it's

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
amazing to me, and,
frankly, it pulls

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
at my heartstrings
a little bit I

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
realize that's not what
you're trying to do

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
but that in the course of your
childhood and in your young

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
adulthood that no one ever
got between you and the world.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
I forget where I heard it
that if a kid has just one

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
person that believes in them--

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
and I had my trials
and tribulations.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
But I had great
coaches, great mentors.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
I attached to them.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I found them if they
didn't necessarily find me.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
But I'm realizing that your
situation was no one's ever

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
said, hey, I'm going to
stand here next to you

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
or get in front of
you, put a shield up.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And so it's almost like
you've got these different--

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
it's all you, but there's
versions of yourself--

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
that like you knew social
media-- like I don't know

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
that I have the wherewithal
in 2013 '14, '15, '16,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
'17 to get in front
of myself while doing

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
all this because I've already
got so much going on in here.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Is that about right?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That is right.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
But I had developed
a lot of anger.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And I still have it.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And it will never go away
for the normal human beings

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
of this world because when
you put yourself in the sewer

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
like I was in-- and please,
if someone saved me,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
come out and announce
it to the world.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
There was no one.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
There's no one.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
So when you know that--

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
and then I'm
sitting at the table

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
with all these smart
people who are telling

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
me what to do and shit and
guiding me through my life

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
now when I'm 40
fucking years old.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
It's 2000-- I don't know
40-something years old.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Now I'm 49.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And I'm looking at them all.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And they're now
trying to guide me

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
on what's right on this poison.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And so, yeah, what
you say is right.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
But for me, it was
more of I know now.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
I don't need you
to guide my future.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
I know what's good for
me and what's bad for me.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And for me, it took every
bit of focus I could.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And I know social media--

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
that's why people love to go on
there because they want to show

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
you the good side of life.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I'm not teaching
good side of life.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
So I had to figure
out a way when

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
I came on 2016 of teaching
you what life really is

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
for the majority of us is hell.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And so while people love to show
you the cars, and the house,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
and the vacations and
shit, all that's good.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
All that's happy.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I'm going to show you the
side that I know most of you

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
are going through.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And people hide very well.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I don't want to hide anymore.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I hid it for 24 fucking years.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
So that's why now
when I told you

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
we can talk about
whatever you want

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
because as human beings, the
first thing we have to learn--

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
I also stuttered
real bad growing up.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
So if you hear me stutter
every now and then,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
it's because that was
part of my life also.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
So it's funny.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Human beings want to
show you the best side.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
And they want to
hide the worst side.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
For me, I'm going
to teach you how

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
to be vulnerable because that's
the only way you fix yourself.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
You don't fix yourself
by coming out here

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
and me selling you
some fucking books.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
That's why I don't have them.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I forgot them.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
I'm glad people got
something from the book.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
I want you to learn that
the only way you grow

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
is how to look at
yourself and say, OK,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
like I did, table longer than
this, what the fuck I have

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
to do to get somewhere?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
There was nothing good
on there, nothing.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Yeah, I loved
playing basketball.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
I left that out.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
That's something I love to do.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
I don't care about that.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
That didn't make
the fucking list

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
because the list
that I had to live by

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
was the very list that was
going to get me at this table

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
with you to talk to you to
the normal human beings, which

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
I once was, about how you can
get somewhere and how it looks.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
It looks very ugly.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
There's no fucking passion.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
There's no fucking motivation.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
There's no, oh my
god, man, I fucking--

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
no, it's every day of
your life just doing,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
no passion, no discipline, no
motivation, all these words.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I hate that so many people
fucking use these words now

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
because it's watered.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Someone sitting in
the room by themselves

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
and they figure themselves
out and say, god, this

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
is going to fucking suck.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Where's passion when
you're 300 pounds?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Where's the motivation when
you can't read and write?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Where is it?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
So how did this happen?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I just fucking did.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
I just did.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
I said maybe at the
end of this journey,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
there will be
something there for me.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
If not, I can read.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
There was no magic potion.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
There was no, oh, let me wake
up and look at some shit.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
No.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
All those words are overused.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
They're bullshit.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
It's all bullshit.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Just do.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
You're living.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
How do you want to live?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
How do you want to die?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
How do you want to
fucking be remembered?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
That's it.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
That's it.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Period.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: As
many of you know,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I've been taking AG1
daily since 2012.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
AG1 is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
that's designed to meet all
of your foundational nutrition

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.000
needs.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Now, of course, I try to get
enough servings of vitamins

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
and minerals through whole foods
sources that include vegetables

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
and fruits every day.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But, oftentimes, I simply
can't get enough servings.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
But with AG1, I'm sure to get
enough vitamins, and minerals,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
and the probiotics that I need.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And it also contains adaptogens
to help buffer stress.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Simply put, I always feel
better when I take AG1.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I have more focus and
energy, and I sleep better.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
And it also happens
to taste great.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
For all these
reasons, whenever I'm

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
asked if you could take just
one supplement what would it be,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I answer AG1.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
If you'd like to try AG1, go to
drinkag1.com/huberman to claim

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
a special offer.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
They'll give you

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
packs plus a year's
supply of vitamin D3, K2.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Again, that's
drinkag1.com/huberman.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
The word haunted is
ringing in my head.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
it's such a powerful word.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Because I was about to m

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
it seems like a huge part
of your process, maybe

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
the entire process, is
it's all stick no carrot,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
you talk about the carrot,
the positive thing.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
And then there's the stick, the
thing you're trying to avoid.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I feel like it's-- the way
it's landing for me is it's all

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
stick and gas pedal.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's no carrot.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
You're not imagining, oh,
when I'm a paramedic, when

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
the book is published.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
And, obviously, you
set those goals,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
and you make those targets.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
But it's all stick.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
DAVID GOGGINS: All stick.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I'm waking up
right now studying.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Like I have a test tomorrow.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
I already passed
the fucking test.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Think about that.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Every day in my life,
that's what I must do just

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
to retain what I learned.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Four hours plus a day, I
go through and do that.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
There's no stick.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Or there's only a stick.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
There's never been
a carrot, which

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
is why when I speak to
people, I have to figure out

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
a way to resonate with them.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Because all I want
to say to them

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
is let me teach you the
real life, how it really is.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
The reason why you're a loser
and the reason why you're not

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
fucking making it and
the reason why you're

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
trying to go to all these--

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I go to all these
fucking conventions,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
speak all the fucking time.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
I look in the fucking audience.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And these people
sign up, sign up,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
sign up fucking every
year go to a convention,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
thinking they're going to learn
something fucking different.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
No, you're lazy.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
You know exactly what to
do, exactly what to do.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Because even me in my state
of I can't read and write,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I knew exactly what to do.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
It just sucks doing it.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
It sucks to do it.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
It sucks to wake up every
morning of your life

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
and say, god, man,
I'm not smart.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
So guess what I got to do.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
I got to study the same shit
that I got one of the highest

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
scores in the nation on and
do it again, and do it again,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
and do it again.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
It's not just there.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
It's not just there
permanently for me.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
So, yeah, it's all stick.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
It's all stick.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000
The only carrot you have
is like maybe, maybe.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Because whenever I take these
tests that are real hard,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
the back of my brain
is like a good chance

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
you're not going to
make it, Goggins.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
This ain't you, bro.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
This ain't you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
You weren't born like this.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
This ain't you.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
The real you, bro--

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
study all you want to.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
But the second that
fucking computer

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
comes on with 150 questions,
this ain't you, man.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And somehow, comes back.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I passed.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
I passed again, passed again.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
But that real me back
here every fucking time

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
is saying that ain't you, bro.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
That ain't you.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And I have to
outwork that voice.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
When I'm taking
that test and I get

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
to a question I don't
fucking know the answer,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I'm like fuck, man.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
And then say, see
I told you, man.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
That ain't you.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
You're 300 pounds, man.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.000
You sit at home.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You figure out how
to do your hair.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
That's what you do,
how to come to school

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
with the reverse
baldness when you're 16.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
That's you.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
So there is no get
out of jail free card.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
This is why I say stay hard.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Because when you
weren't given the gifts,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
the only thing you can
do in life is stay hard.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And I know people
cannot stand me.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
They can't stand this talk.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
This is all you can do.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
There's no magic pill
or a magic potion.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
All you can do is
outwork the man

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
that God created
or woman in you.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And what that looks
like is unfun.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
That's why I said, do not
do a documentary on me

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
because people will
not see the truth.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
They will see what
they want to see is

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I don't want to live like that.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Good, good.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And you will live
exactly the way

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
you live now,
questioning who you are,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
wondering what is
possible, wondering

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
what you are capable of doing.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
That's how that looks or you
can be me, which am I happy?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.000
I don't know.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Never really thought about it.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Don't really care about
it because all I really

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
cared about was when I looked
in that fucking mirror,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
I saw a piece of shit.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Happiness wasn't on the mirror
at 16 or when I was 300 pounds.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
It wasn't like, I'm
looking for happiness.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
No, I'm looking at myself in
the mirror and say, all right,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
motherfucker, you
did it again today.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You're a bad boy
because that shit sucks.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I have about a couple of minutes
of that that I got the carrot.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
The second I lay down and
go to bed, the carrots gone

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
because I'm waking up all
through the night to check

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
the work I did that day.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Did I get this drug right?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Did I get this right?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Did I get that right?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
What did I do?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Oh my god, fuck, I'm
already losing it.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Stick.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: That
stick's haunting you.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
following you around.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So no picture of
Jordan on the wall.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
You're not listening to
YouTube inspiration video.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
DAVID GOGGINS: No.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would
be all your voice anyway.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
You're not listening to
your top 10 favorite songs

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
just to get rolling and then
lace the shoes, hit the books.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
It's all in here.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
DAVID GOGGINS: All in there.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
I used to do that
when I was fat.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Rocky, I mean,
that was my thing.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Round 14 was my thing.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
And as I got older and older and
older, that started to go away.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
And I started to create--

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
I had all these people
that I used to watch.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Rocky was one, Barnes,
Elias from "Platoon,"

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Jack from "A Few Good Men" when
he's on the stand going crazy.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I saw a lot of these
characters that I looked at

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
and I was like, man, I
ain't got none of that.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
But they were characters.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
After a while, I lived
a life so disciplined

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
that every body
that I once looked

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
to, these fake characters,
I built that as a man.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
And when I was younger, I
had this image in my mind

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
of what does a man
look like to me?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And I got all these people
who are badasses, characters.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And in my mind, I became that.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
And that's what kept
me going a lot was

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I had this pipe dream of
becoming a little bit of this

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
and a little bit of
that because when

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
you have no parents
raising you and you

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
have no role models growing
up, it's not daydreaming.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:25.000
You start to create a reality
like, mm, maybe I can be that.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And after becoming
this guy, that

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
is the biggest thing I
can ever do in my life is

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I became that guy.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
That I once looked at
all these, guys and now

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
I look at myself like, god,
who the fuck can do that?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I can.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
But what it takes
is a discipline

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
that no one can ever even--

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
they don't understand it.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
They don't understand it.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
But everybody has
the ability to do it,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
but they just don't want to.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
They want to keep
asking questions

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
and keep going to seminars.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And the greatness
is right in you.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And that's why once again--

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I say this a million times here,
I do not feel sorry for you.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I will not sugarcoat
what I'm going

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
to say to you because
all of you know

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
what I'm saying is the truth.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Everybody knows it's the truth.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
This is what it looks like.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
And you know it too.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
You know it too.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
If you ain't got nothing, I hate
to tell you what it looks like.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
It's ugly.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
It's not a documentary.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
It's not an HBO special.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
You ain't going to
watch me like, hey, man,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
you guys gotta watch this.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
No, it's like, oh, god, this
looks like a train wreck.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
It's like a nightmare.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
This looks like this guy's got--
no, that's what it looks like.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Hard work looks horrible.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
It's not motivating.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
It's not motivating at all.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
It ain't like Rocky round 14
where he gets knocked down

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
and goes like this
to Apollo Creed.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Looks like a man being
stuck in a fucking dungeon.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And there's no fucking way out.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
But you have the fucking key.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
But you refuse to use it.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And that's nothing
motivating about that.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
So, yes, no documentary
on David Goggins.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life--

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
DAVID GOGGINS: The real life.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --David
Goggins is the documentary.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
It's already being written.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
You're it.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm going
to share a little neuroscience

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
tidbit.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Love it.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But I think it's one

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
that you'll appreciate.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Most people don't
know this, but there's

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
a brain structure called the
anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
As we pointed out
before, that's a noun.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.000
It's a name.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
It doesn't mean anything.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
We could call it
the Cookie Monster.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
But what's interesting
about this brain

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
area is there are
now a lot of data

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
in humans, not some mouse study,
showing that when people do

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
something they don't
want to do like add three

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
hours of exercise
per day or per week

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
or when people who are trying
to diet and lose weight

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
resist eating something,
when people do anything

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
that they, and this
is the important part,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
that they don't want to do,
it's not about adding more work.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
It's about adding more work
that you don't want to do.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
This brain area gets bigger.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Now here's what's especially
interesting about this brain

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
area to me.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And by the way, I'm
only learning this

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
recently because it's new data.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
But there's a lot of it.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
The anterior
mid-cingulate cortex

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
is smaller in obese people.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
It gets bigger when they diet.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
It's larger in athletes.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
It's especially
large or grows larger

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
in people that see
themselves as challenged

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
and overcome some challenge.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
And in people that
live a very long time,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
this area keeps its size.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
In many ways,
scientists are starting

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
to think of the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex not just

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
as one of the seats of
willpower but perhaps actually

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the seat of the will to live.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
DAVID GOGGINS: See,
now we're talking.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And when I learned

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
about the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I was like almost
out of my seat.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
And I've been in the
neuroscience game

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
since I was 20.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Now we're talking.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
We're the same age.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And I was so pumped because I've
heard of the amygdala, fear,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
prefrontal cortex.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
It's planning an action.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
I could tell you every
brain area and every--

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I teach neuroanatomy
to medical students.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
But when I started
seeing the data

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
on the anterior mid-cingulate
cortex, I was like, whoa,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
this is interesting.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
And all the data
point to the fact

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
that we can build this area up.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
But that as quickly
as we build it up,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
if we don't continue to invest
in things that are hard for us,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
that we don't want to
do-- that's the part that

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
feels so Goggin-esque to me,
that we don't want to do.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Like if you love the ice bath--
yeah, I love the ice bath--

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
and you go from 1
minute to 10 minutes,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
guess what, your anterior
mid-cingulate cortex did not

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
grow.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
DAVID GOGGINS: None.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if
you hate the cold water,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
if you're afraid of drowning
and you get into water

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
and put your head
under and survive,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
then the anterior mid-cingulate
cortex gets bigger.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
But if you don't do it the next
day or if you do it the next

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
day and you enjoy it because,
hey, hey, I did it yesterday,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
woo-hoo, happy me, Merry
Christmas as you would say--

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Merry Christmas.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess
what, the anterior

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
mid-cingulate cortex
shrinks again.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
To me, this is one of the
most important discoveries

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
that neuroscience has
ever made because it's

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
that I don't want to do
something but do it anyway

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
that grows this area.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And it's almost like--

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
I have a friend.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
He's been sober 30
years from alcohol.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
And he always says, the
amazing thing about addiction

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
is there's a cure.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
The problem is it only
works one day at a time.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
And so you have to
renew it every day.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior
mid-cingulate cortex to me--

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
when I learned about it, two
things went off in my head.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Whoa, this is super interesting.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And, two, I got to tell
David Goggins about this.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And I waited until now--

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell
you because I felt like, well,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
for obvious reasons
I wanted to tell you

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
and I wanted to tell you here.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Well, I
love that because that's

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
how I've lived my entire life.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
I don't know
anything about that.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
But people go, man, you
have such a strong will.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
It's something that you build.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Like I never forget I was
on a podcast one time.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
And this dude goes you were
blessed with a strong mind.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Like the hell are
you talking about I

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
was blessed with a strong mind?

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
That's something that
you have to develop.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
You develop that over
years, decades of suffering

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
and going back into the suffer.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
That's why a lot of people who
graduate Navy SEAL training,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
they want to know--

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
I talk about it very
openly all the time.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
A lot of guys don't want
to go back into that water,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
don't want to go back
into the hard stuff.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
And maybe not-- anything
hard, anything hard

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
in life, once you get through
it, it's like you become a POW.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Like how many POWs you know
want to go back to POW camp?

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
None.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
When something sucks
so bad in life--

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
this is on this that
we're talking about now--

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
very few people want to go back.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
They're happy they graduated.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
I realized I'm the same way.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
I don't want to go back.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
I have to go back.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
I must go back because that is
exactly where all the knowledge

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
of my life exists was back
there in what you're exactly

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
what you're talking about.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Well, I didn't know
anything about this.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
But how I grew a will was
constantly doing these things

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
to now it's just life.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:37.000
I wake up.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
While it still sucks,
it's just life.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
You don't sit back
and like, oh my god.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Like I have days I
don't want to do.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
But I know I'm going to do it.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I know from years
of just doing it.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
So that's beautiful.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And this is why I came
on here with you today.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
And I'm glad that you're talking
about this because human beings

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
need to hear this.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
They need to stop hearing
these hacks on this and that.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
There's no fucking hack, bro.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
There's no fucking hack.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Yeah, you may this and that
and saunas and all this shit

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
that they-- yeah, it's great.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
There is no fucking life hack.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
To grow that thing--
how do you grow it?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Do it, and do it,
and do it, and do it.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
That's the hack.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
The hack is going
to fucking suck.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
And that's what I realized.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
That's what I realized.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
That's why I wanted
to come on here today.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
I didn't want to
come on here and talk

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
about no fucking
passion and purpose

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
and how to get the
fuck out of bed

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
and how to hit a
fucking alarm clock,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000
all this catchphrase bullshit
because that wasn't how

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
I lived, wasn't how I lived.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
I lived, I woke up like
every human being does

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
and goes fuck, man.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I'm a fucking piece
of shit today.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
How the hell is this
going to work out for me?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And you fight that.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
And you fight that.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
You don't override it.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
There's no override button.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
It's the conversation
in your head.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So how do you do that?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
We don't have enough
of these conversations

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
about the real conversation that
every human being is having.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
And they have no idea
how to get out of it.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000
But they do is that
shit right there, man.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
You got to build your will.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
How you build your will?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Exactly what you said, man.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Exactly what you said.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I feel like knowing

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
the name of something,
anterior mid-cingulate cortex,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
doesn't fundamentally change us.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
But one thing I
like about biology

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
is that willpower, if somebody
feels they don't have it,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
feels like this thing
that other people have.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
But everybody, unless
they're brain-damaged,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
like a hole through their
head, has two anterior

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
mid-cingulate cortex, one
on each side of their brain.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Everyone has one.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
They have two.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
So I feel like it's just a
question of opening the portal.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
And the portal-- again,
I'm going to say 10 times,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
and forgive me--
is I think people

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
go, oh, I do hard things.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
I do sets to failure.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And then I do forced reps.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
I love training with weights.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I love doing sets to failure.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I even like forced reps.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
But guess what?

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
I like forced reps.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
So I'll tell you,
they don't build

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
my anterior mid-cingulate
cortex because I like to do it.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Anything you like
to do is not going

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
to enhance this
aspect of willpower.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
And it seems so obvious
once you hear it.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
You kind of go, oh
yeah, of course.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
But I think you really
close that loop for people

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
when you share what
you're sharing today

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
and what you've shared
elsewhere before as well.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
When you're trying to
explain the friction

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
is the critical ingredient.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
And I think people think,
oh, if it's effort, well,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
then I'm getting better.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
That's part of it, necessary,
but not sufficient,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
as we say in science.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:52.000
But the suck part, the haunt,
being haunted, the stick,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
they're really unpleasant terms.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
These are probably the most
unpleasant terms we've ever

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
used on this podcast.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Those are the--
those are the levers.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Those are the gears.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
And without those, this thing
that you're talking about,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
David Goggins, as a verb--

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
I sometimes make the
joke, but it's not a joke.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Goggins is a name,
and it's a verb.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
People go, I'm on
to Goggins that.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
But that's, I think--

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
again, I'm not a psychologist.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
But I think that's what
you're talking about,

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
the stick, the
friction, being haunted.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
It's the suck part that grows
this anterior mid-cingulate

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
cortex.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
DAVID GOGGINS: So
now you know why

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
there's so many people
that fail in this world

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
to figure out their purpose,
their purpose in life.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Where do I go?

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Because to grow that, now,
you may not look like me,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
how my daily life looks.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
It don't look fun.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Don't look fun.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
So it's a choice that
people have to make in life.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
But what's so funny about it
is even the richest of rich,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
who have everything, they
always ask me this question.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I feel like I'm
missing something.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
I don't feel like
I'm missing shit.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
I don't have what you all have.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
But you will never in
my life hear me tell you

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
I'm missing something.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And everybody is.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000
They're missing this feeling.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
I found it a long time ago.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
And I found it right there
in that willpower thing.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
When you're nothing,
nothing, and change yourself

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000
into something, like me, you
call it happiness, peace,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
whatever the fuck
you want to call it,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
people are missing exactly what
went on with David Goggins.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Why don't you smile?

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I do.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
I do.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
But I figured something out.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
That's why I am never--

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
you never hear me say,
I'm missing something.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
I found it years ago.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
You find it in the suck.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
You find it in the suck.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
And you find it repeatedly
in the suck to the point

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
where you know
exactly who you are.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Most people are
missing something

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000
because they don't
know who they are.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
They never examined themselves.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
They've never done this
experiment on themselves.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
The lab rat.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
We're all lab rats.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
But you're also the scientist.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
You create your own self.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Most people are
missing something

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
because there's so
much trapped in there.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I don't even want
to say potential.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
I think that's a word--
it's used out too much too.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
There's so much in you that
God or whoever the hell

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
you believe in or if
you're an atheist in you

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
that you have not unlocked,
that you walk around

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
with this gorgeous wife or great
husband and all this money.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
You're like, god, I feel
like I'm missing something.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Yeah, because it's
about 75% of you

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000
is still fucking in there, still
chained up because you just

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
didn't want to find
your willpower,

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
didn't want to find your
soul, your will, your heart,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000
your determination,
your guts, your courage.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
And what that looks
like, it looks scary,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
like you're little
scary lab that went in.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Scary to wake up every
day and say, I'm stupid,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
but I'm going to
figure out a way

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
to be smarter versus saying,
man, I just can't do that.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
So you limit this box.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
So your box becomes so
small of things you can do.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
My box wasn't even a box.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
It was a fucking little pinhole.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And then through
examining myself,

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
getting some willpower,
some courage,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
it became bigger
than this table.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
But that's what we all do.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
That's why I wanted to
come here today and talk

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000
to you about real shit,
not no fucking hacks.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
There's no hacks, bro.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
It's you against you.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
You against you.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
And if you
misunderstand that, you

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
have a real problem,
real problem.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
I can understand
you misunderstand

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
me, running down the street,
shirt off, fuck this, no.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Yeah.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:04.000
I can get it.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
I get it.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
If you misunderstand what
I'm saying right now today,

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
the problem is you.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
And you don't want to fix it.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the
children of wealthy people

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000
are a case study in how
not having enough friction

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
can destroy a life.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
DAVID GOGGINS: True statement.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
mean, I could list off

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
prominent names in the press.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
But those are actually
the least interesting.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
What's probably more
interesting, as an example,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
is all the ones we don't
hear about because we never

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000
hear about them.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
They just dwindle and wither.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Or I think there's this
big category of people,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000
I'm realizing, as we have this
conversation today that they're

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
not super successful.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
They're not struggling.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
They're successful enough
that they never have to--

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
you can get to the
point where you

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
don't have to impose friction.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
You even said it.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Your bank account is in a
place where you don't really

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
need to do all
the things you do,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
probably not even a
small fraction of them.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But you realize the
stick and being haunted

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
is the fuel and the engine.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And you'd be a-- you'd be
truly crazy to give that up

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
because you've
internalized all that.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But most people, they're
good enough for them.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And so they don't actually
want to be better badly enough

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
in order to start
going rung after rung.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Well, think
about when you build willpower.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And think about how
much I've built.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Now that you know about this--

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I didn't know about this.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But think about how
much I've built.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Everything I've ever done in
my life, I didn't want to do.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Everything every day.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I'm a lazy piece of shit.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And I'm one of the hardest
working people to ever step

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
foot on this planet Earth.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And I'm saying that very proudly
because I know what I do.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It's not cocky.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I'll tell you I'm stupid.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And I'll also tell you the exact
opposite of what I've done.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's the truth.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It is the truth.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So imagine how much I've
developed in that time frame.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But this is the scary thing.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Why most people don't want to
do that and build that willpower

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
is because it is scary.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It unlocks a whole bunch
of things about who you are

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and who you're not.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And a lot of people don't
want to go down that journey

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
to discover who they
are and who they're not

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
because it's not
a pretty journey.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I mean, I've gone down it.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It's not like I
went down it once.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I go down it all the time.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And when you unlock that-- and
you can't just turn it off.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Like, people say, hey, how
come you haven't retired yet?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I built all this willpower.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Do you think it's
going to let me just

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
retire because my knees hurt?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It is telling me every morning--

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I wake up, and I'm like,
man, my knees hurt.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.000
My legs hurt.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
My body hurts.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
But you can still run.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So why aren't you running?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
If you can still run--

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
there will be a time when you
can't lace them up anymore.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But you can still run.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So I still run.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
When the time comes I can't
run, the body will say,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
you just can't run.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But if I can still
do something, that

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
willpower that I
have created, it

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
makes me do it
every fucking day.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And that's what they don't get.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
What builds a human being is you
start with the small building

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
blocks.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And before you know it,
man, you become something

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
that it doesn't even
make sense to most people

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
because it's just
who you are now.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That's why I can still
run at 50 with broke--

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
at 49 with broke down
knees and broke down body

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
because my body
knows you still can.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Therefore, I do.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Second you stop, the
willpower is gone.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And that's beautiful.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I'm so glad you brought that to
me because I always wondered,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
what's this
separation thing now?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
At 24 years old, I
started building something

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
that I didn't even
know was going

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
to be what it is now at 49.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And that's all it was.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It was just that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,
anterior mid-cingulate cortex,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
has inputs and outputs
from a bunch of places.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But you'll probably not
be surprised to learn

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
that it's strongly activated
when we move our body when

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
we don't want to move our body.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I feel like it's like the
David Goggins structure.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It really is.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And it also has
strong connections

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
to the dopamine reward pathway.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And everyone goes,
yay, dopamine.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Everyone loves dopamine.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I'm partially responsible
for people knowing a bit more

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
about dopamine.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But dopamine's badly understood.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Everyone thinks
dopamine, dopamine hits.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's about reward.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's about motivation and drive.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And there are pain inputs to the
dopamine centers of the brain.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
No one talks about that.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Everyone's like, oh, you want
the chocolate, chocolate, sex,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
cocaine.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Yeah, that's all true.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It'll release dopamine.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Pain releases dopamine.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
The anterior
mid-cingulate cortex

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
can trigger the release
of dopamine in response

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
to this thing that
we're calling friction.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And that's a learned thing.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That's something that
no animal or human being

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
comes into the world learning.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We all are averse to pain.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And like pleasure,
like sugar, fat.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Don't like hot surfaces.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
But this is a
structure that learns.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It has neuroplasticity,
the ability

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to change throughout
the entire life span.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And here's the
part that I think,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
again, is just neuro nerd
speak for what you already know

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and have done and exemplify,
is that people say,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
oh, it has plasticity.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You can change it.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But guess what?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It has plasticity
in both directions.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
It can grow.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But just as easily as it can
grow, it's like Silly Putty,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
it can shrink.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So it requires constant upkeep.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And that answer isn't one
that people are going to like.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
They're like, give
me the energy drink.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Give me the supplement.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Give me the-- give me
the sauna protocol that's

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
going to make my anterior
mid-cingulate cortex-- there's

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
someone out there
right now who's going,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
wait, if I took transcranial
magnetic stimulation

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and I stimulate-- yeah, you'd
probably-- actually, they've

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.000
done that.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
They stuck a little
wire during neurosurgery

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
into this structure.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
This was actually
discovered by a colleague

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
of mine, Joe Parvizi.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Stimulate.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And the patients go, I feel
like there's a storm coming.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And they go, oh, is it scary?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And they go, no, I
want to go through it.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
They come off the stimulation,
and people are like--

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
this is the seat of what
we're talking about.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Exactly.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So the fact that you've
kept this brain structure--

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I'm convinced if we imaged
your brain, it'd be large,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
and it would be larger
in two years, in a year.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
But this is the no days off
rationale because it can grow,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
and it can shrink.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I know.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
What you're saying right now,
I didn't know any of this.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And I never-- and I
always talk to you.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
But I wish I could
just put this on paper.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And you're saying it in a way
that people can understand.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I can never put it into
words on what I built

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and the power that
is within all of us.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
But you put it so
in a scientific way.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Most people, for
me, he's just crazy.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That's why I don't like
talking about it, man.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I know I'm not crazy.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I know what I had to do
to get where I had to go.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
People look at it as crazy
because there are people

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
that just--

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
if you can't imagine
yourself doing something,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
if you can't imagine
yourself doing something,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
the person that's
doing it is crazy

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
because in your mind, the logic
behind it, it doesn't compute.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Therefore, you have to
give somebody a title.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And the title for me
is usually he's crazy

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
or he's this, he's that.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
No.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
No.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
For some reason, me
wanting to be somebody

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
so fucking bad in my
life, I created that.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And I've been
trying to figure out

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
years of my life trying
to explain to people.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
But even though you're
explaining it now,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
this is the easy fucking part.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Them listening to this shit
is the easy fucking part.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The part that why they're
always be the ones of ones

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
is because putting
that practice,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
putting that into
actual work, no, man.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
No.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:27.000
No.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's where the demons come in.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
That's where you're like,
I don't want to be better.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I don't want to be better.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
If this is what it
takes to be better,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I don't want to be better.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So everybody's-- that's why
there's a lot of average.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And it makes me so fucking mad.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Every day I walk this
Earth, and I see average

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
all over the fucking place.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And they want to ask
me, how did you do it?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I can't tell you how because
you're not going to fucking--

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
you're not going to do it.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
You're not going to do it you.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You're just going to--

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
You're going to continue
being like this every day

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
you wake up.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Like you said, it's
like, get the coffee.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Make the pancakes.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Kiss the girl.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Kiss the kids.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You wake up, right to work.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Immediate, your
mind is in action.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
No one wants to do that.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.000
No one.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And I don't blame them.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But don't be mad when
you're laying there

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
in your fucking bed, and
you're in the fucking hospital,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and you're 70, 80, 90 years old.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And you're thinking,
man, I feel like I

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
didn't fucking do something.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Because you did.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
You didn't do it.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You didn't do shit.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You may have lived
a great life, man,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
but you're always going
to feel empty inside.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I don't feel empty.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So call me what you want.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
There's not one empty
bone in my fucking body

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
because I have figured
out that really--

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the magic potion,
at least to my life.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And it's very rewarding.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a quick break

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and thank our sponsor,
InsideTracker.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
to help me better
understand your body

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
and help you reach
your health goals.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
your immediate and
long-term health

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Now, a major problem
with a lot of blood

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
tests out there, however,
is that you get information

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and so forth.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
But you don't know what to
do with that information

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
With InsideTracker,
they make it very easy,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
because they have a
personalized platform, that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
allows you to see
the levels of all

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
those things, metabolic factors,
lipids, hormones, et cetera.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But it gives you
specific directives

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
that you can follow that
relate to nutrition,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
behavioral modification,
supplements,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
et cetera that
can help you bring

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
those numbers into the ranges
that are optimal for you.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
If you'd like to
try InsideTracker,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
you can go to

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
to get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Again, that's
insidetracker.com/huberman.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
People like to talk about what
they used to be able to do.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I hear this a lot.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You should have seen
me in high school.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I always laugh.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Like, yeah, OK.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Got it.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And it's not just guys.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You should have seen me
working out in high school.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I was super fit.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
People will look
back to a time where

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
they felt like they were
capable of something.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And now they're not.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And you kind of want to
just grab them and go, wait.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.000
That was you then.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It's you now.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And but people tend
to think about how

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
the conditions that
were around success

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
must have been part of it.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And you can understand why.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
It's very rational.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I was in that situation.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I was successful.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I'm in this situation.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I'm not.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That was the past.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
This is the present.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Ergo, capable.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You see how people
get into these loops.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And as you mentioned, you spent
the first 20 years of your life

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
in extremely challenged
circumstances.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And then you can see how
people get to a point

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
where everything feels hard.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Like, when you're 300 pounds--

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I haven't ever been 300 pounds.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But I can't imagine it feels
good to get up and move around.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
He's in excess of 300 pounds.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
We've been trying
on him for years.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But no win.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And he's got crazy psoriasis
on the back of his calves.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And he actually
smells bad sometimes

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
because he can't wash
as well as he would.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
He's big, big.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And it pulls all my sympathy.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But life is very hard for
him and getting worse.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
He's a young guy with
a lot of medical issues

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
now, for obvious reasons.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And so I think people like that
think, well, it's already hard.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Why would I make it harder?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Your message is a
little different.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And you have the
life experience.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's
a lot different.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You've been there.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So for me, saying, oh
yeah, lose weight--

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I was a skinny guy who got
to be a less skinny guy.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So I don't really have
a foot to stand on.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
What do you say to those
people who are like,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
listen, getting up in
the morning is hard.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Trying to not dissolve into
a puddle of my own tears

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and my own misery is hard.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
DAVID GOGGINS: You know why
people connect with my books

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.000
so well?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
For some reason, God put me
in almost every fucked up

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
situation on the planet Earth.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So when I talk to people,
it's not sugar-coated

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.000
because I'm not saying it from I
was a 175 pounds my whole life.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I don't say much
to those people.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Maybe you're a piece of shit.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Maybe you want to be nobody.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Maybe you're happy exactly
where you are in life

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
because obviously, you are.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Maybe you don't have
the determination

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
to be somebody better
than who you are.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And if you want to live with
that, I'll support you in that.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
If you're good with being who
you are, that every day you

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
wake up, and every day, you
smell like shit because you

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
can't wash your body well,
and your skin is messed up

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
because your health's
so bad, and you

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
can't put your clothes on
right, you need help with that.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
You need help like--
when I was 300 pounds,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I needed help wiping my ass.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
That makes you feel good?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Nothing I can say to you.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If every day you wake up with
this-- see, people are haunted.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
But they obviously
like horror films

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
because they keep watching
the same fucking movie.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I don't like horror films.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
A lot of people
like horror films.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So I don't say much to them.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I say exactly what I
said to you right there

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
because I was once you.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I didn't like horror
films, so I changed it.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Some people are just--

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
they become-- like you
said, it gets real small

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
when you're lazy and
you're fat, your will.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Their will is so small
that they don't have any.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And you can't give it to them.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
There has to be
something-- this is

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
what I'm talking about now
because this isn't a hack.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
This has to be in you.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Something in you has to wake up.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And usually, the only person
that can wake it up is you.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Sometimes you can read
a David Goggins book

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
because I was all this shit and
then a lot more of fucked up.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
But if you don't have a
little flame, just barely--

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
you're done.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I can't light it for you.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And that's the harsh
reality of this life

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
that I want to get
across so fucking bad.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
You can watch me.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You can watch you.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
You can watch fucking
Rogan and Cameron

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Hanes, all these motherfuckers.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You can go to Tony
Robbins's fucking bullshit,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
all this shit.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You can do all this shit.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
You're going to keep
going back and keep

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
spending money and
spending money and spending

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
money with no results.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You're going to wonder, wow.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Maybe let me go try
out David Goggins.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
He ain't going to
fucking help you.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You have to explore, examine
the insides of yourself.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And what do you really
want out of life?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Your friend and a lot
of people out here

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
just don't fucking want it.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So guess what?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Have fun with your life.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Go from 300 to 350
to 400 to 450 to 500

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
because you don't want it.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And that's the harsh reality.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I can't give you shit.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
You can't give them shit.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
We can give you ideas.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
But end of the day, when
I was losing the weight,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I had to miserably wake up
every morning in the cold

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
because it was Indiana,
November, when it started.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I was miserable.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
This is your new life.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Take it or leave it.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
There's no happiness about it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
There's no peace behind it.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It sucks.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It just fucking sucks.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And that's the one thing, if I
could teach anybody anything,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
it just fucking sucks.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And it's going to
continue to suck.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And then one day, you'll get
to a special part in your life

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
that it might get a
little bit better.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But to lose the weight you
have to lose, my friend, sorry.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's going to suck every
fucking day because then when

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
you're 300 pounds, you're
going to go out to lose weight,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
you could probably get injured.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
So then you got to
work on the injury.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And then you get
even more depressed.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
This is what I went through.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And then you're hungry
because now you're depressed.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It's just a vicious cycle.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And if you're not
strong mentally

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
and you have no
willpower, you're

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
going to continue
falling back in this hole

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
versus the man that
sits back and goes,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
all right, motherfucker.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This is why I cuss because
this is what is in me.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
This is what it took
for me to be me.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Sorry.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It didn't take, hey, OK,
we're going to do this today.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.000
No.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
This fucking really sucks.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
This is real, dude.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
This is real.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
And every day, I'm set back.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm set back.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I'm set back.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I'm set back.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
So this is what I
would tell your boy.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
This is exactly
what I'd tell him.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Every day you wake up,
you're going to probably

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
be set back for the
first four weeks

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
before you lose significant
weight because the mind is

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
going to be fucking
with you the whole time.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
There's no dopamine.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
There's no dopamine in
there at 300 pounds.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You got nothing.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Your hormones are shot.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You have to envision something
that is more powerful than you.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Something has to
get you out of bed.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And you have to create it.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It has to be false
because you're not it.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You're a fat piece of shit.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And that's the reality of it.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So you have to create a false
reality, to live in that

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
just to get to work on yourself.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
That's the reality.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'll
see this, and he'll

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
appreciate that message.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
We'll see what he does.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last
13 years, it's been no movement.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But I have had other
friends who were

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
drug and alcohol addicts who
quit after one conversation.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Never went back.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
That means they want it.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just
one guy, I won't out him,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
but walked up to me at a
party in 2019, July 4th party,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and said, I'm a pile.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And I go, what?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And he goes, I'm a pile.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Look at me.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I'm 60 pounds overweight.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And I go, do you drink?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.000
He goes, every day.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I go, how much?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
He goes, a case.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
He goes, I smoke a lot of weed.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But he's successful in
other areas of his life.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And so I said, well,
here's what I know.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Quit alcohol and weed for you.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I'm not telling
people what to do.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Don't eat until 2:00 PM.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Get on an exercise
bike, and pedal

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
in the morning like someone's
chasing you with a poison dart

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
until you want to puke.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And I was kind of half-joking.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And then two months
later, he was, like,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I haven't had a drink.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I lost 30 pounds.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
He lost those 60 pounds.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.000
He never went back.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Now, he's super fit.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's amazing.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So some people flip the switch.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
He is very
self-critical by nature.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
That's what flips--

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's
super self-critical.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:53.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yep.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
That's what flips the switch.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Think about it, man.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
We know what to do.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
We don't need Andrew Huberman
to tell us what to do.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
We know what to do,
every one of us.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
That's why he flipped it so
fast because he knew what to do.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
He didn't go by
your exact protocol.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
He didn't go by the exact--

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:15.000
no.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
He knew exactly what to do.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And you just saying some shit
to him, it woke something up.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
He knew what to do.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And that's the thing that
people need to get that.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You know what to do.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Why aren't you doing it?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm
talking about myself now.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Those modes of just kind
of passive consumption,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
they're so easy to wash over us.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I used to have this thing,
and I'm fighting this

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
now because I knew we were
going to have this conversation

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
today, where I like
to start things

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
on the hour or the half hour.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Worst practice in
the world for me

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
because if I miss that half
hour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'll start at 12:45.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Ah, it's 12:45.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I'll start at 1:00.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I just lost time.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And so this is so stupid.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And the other day,
I was like, man, I

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
got to tell David about this
because my new thing is I start

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
no matter what time it is.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
If I wake up in the
middle of the night--

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I got a friend.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
He paints in the
middle of the night.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I'm like, you're an insomniac?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
He's like, I don't know.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I just do it.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Then sometimes he
goes back to sleep.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Sometimes he doesn't.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Everyone's got their thing.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
But I thought about this.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I'm like, no more am I
going to say I'm starting

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
at 1:00 because I know me.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
If I miss the 1:00 ding and then
my pen's not hitting the paper

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
or I'm not typing
on the keyboard,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I'm not going to do it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But That's a
self-admitted weakness.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I had that for a lot of years.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I know I'm going to do it.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
That's the haunting part is
that it's going to happen.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
It has to happen.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And that's a fact.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Like, there's no get out
of jail free card, bro.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
None.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Like, that is a life
that I don't know.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I don't have that ability.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Or I have the ability.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I don't have the--

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'm not good enough,
smart enough.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I'm not talented
enough to do that.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Some people are.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Some people can start at 1:00.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Some people don't
have to start at all.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
If you lack talent, you
can't sit back and say,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I'll start in half an hour.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I can't do that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I got to start now.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And after I get back from
starting, I got to start again.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And then when I get done with
that run or that study session,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
if it wasn't good enough,
I got to go back again

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
because repetition is
what taught me everything.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
So you can honestly
outwork anything.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
But it's that you, obviously,
are a very talented man.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have
worked hard at certain things

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
and built up some
things that I've

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
been good at most of my life.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
DAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,
organizing, and disseminating

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
information's
something I've been

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
doing since I was a little kid.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I used to give lectures at
school on Monday about stuff

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I learned over the weekend.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
DAVID GOGGINS: See,
check that out.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But they
took me to a psychiatrist.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We're the same age.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Back then, if you got
sent to a psychiatrist,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
people thought you were crazy.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So I remember
feeling like a freak.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Also, I didn't have a stutter,
but I had a grunting tic.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It comes back when I'm tired.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And the only thing that
helped that was hitting

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
my head on something,
shaking my head,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
which is why skateboarding
was good because I'd slam,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and I'd feel like, oh.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I feel good.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But that's not healthy.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
That's not good.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Or just work.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Work is what gets it out.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It's like an-- it's
like an RPM or high.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
[REVVING SOUND]
Anyway, that's me.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But yeah, I think
certain things over time,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I feel like talent or gifts or
whatever you want to call them,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
but there are many
things that are

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
exceedingly difficult for me.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And I have learned
from your example.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I know that you are very
both humble and very clear

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that you don't have--
you say, you're

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
not going to get it
by examining you.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
But I think the way
you're sharing today

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
and the way you've shared
it on other podcasts before,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
there are pieces
that really help

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
people feel into
the process of what

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
you're talking about today.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
We're elaborating on it, I
think, a lot, this notion

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
of being haunted and the stick.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I mean, of course, of course,
now it makes so much sense why

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
you don't want to talk about
sleep or rest or recovery

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
because that's--

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
sure, that's important.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I've heard you say,
yes, you sleep.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yes, you eat.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Yes, you hydrate.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yes, you will stretch
your psoas or whatever.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
But it's funny how that
becomes the viral message.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's why
I said fuck that today.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
that's not the unique--

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
that's not the unique
message that you carry.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Like, anyone can
talk about that.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So do I have that right?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
That you're acknowledging
sleep is important.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Recovery is important.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's
not what you're about.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: You have
to forego something.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yes.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Ice baths.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Saunas.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Sleep.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Nutrition.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
All this shit's so
fucking important, dude.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I don't have time
for some of it.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
To extract what I had to
extract, something had to give.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Like, you talk about you
when you were younger.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
You would give these
speeches and stuff.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
The same age you
were giving speeches,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I was trying to figure out how
to say the without stuttering.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And I realized, as I got older,
that all these things are

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
important.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But for me to stop
stuttering, I got

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
to build fucking confidence.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And speech therapy
didn't help that.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Nothing helped that.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I have to forgo a lot of
shit to be as fucked up

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
as I am to build
confidence, for me

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
to stand in a fucking room of
10,000-- of one person, and not

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
[STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be
like, oh, and put my head down.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Let me look around.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Let me read these
paragraphs first.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
And then before I
read the paragraphs,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
because they're
calling me next, let

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
me just leave the room
because I'm going to stutter.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
That's a miserable life.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And that's one of many
things I did besides lying,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
besides being insecure,
besides being immature,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
besides being fat, besides
being one of the only Black kids

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.000
in my school.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
There's a lot of things I had
to overcome to gain confidence.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And in doing so, a
lot of that had to go.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
A lot of it.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So I became the guy that became,
once again, misunderstood.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You only sleep four hours
a day, two hours a day?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Sometimes you
don't sleep at all?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Like, what's this, and
what's this, and what's this?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I know it's all important.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I can't.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Something's got to go.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
For me to get confidence,
because confidence

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
is the building block of
where I'm trying to go,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
for me to gain
confidence in myself,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
this fucked up kid has got
to do a lot of fucked up shit

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
to gain confidence.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And along the way,
the stutter went away.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And I gained confidence.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And now, my life is
a little bit more--

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
there is no balance.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
There is no balance.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It's a little bit more what it
should be for a lot of people.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
But there'll never be balance
because confidence is something

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
that you're constantly--

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
confidence and belief
you're building every day.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And so something's got to give.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And I'm willing to
forego a lot of things

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
to have that because
I know if you

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
want to give
somebody kryptonite,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
take that shit away from them.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So yeah, I don't
sleep sometimes.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And sometimes I don't
eat the right way.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And sometimes I don't do this
and do that and whatever, man.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
But you put me in a room
of 10,000 people any time

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
of the day, and I'll
walk in there thinking

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I'm the baddest
motherfucker in here

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
because I know what it
took to be on this stage.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And a lot of people
would not do that.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So that's what it takes.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's a question

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I've been wanting to ask
you since we started.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And I thought about
coming in here.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And I've been thinking about
in the weeks ahead of this.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And I'm going to just come
clean and say I don't exactly

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
know how to ask the question.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
about relationships.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So I know in myself

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
that my discipline is much
higher when it's just me.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But that's because I had
certain things early on.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
But then I was a
terrible student.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Barely finished high school.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
But then when I got
serious, I got serious.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
But I did that by staying
away from everybody.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And anyone's who's ever had
a relationship of any kind,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
but in particular,
romantic relationships,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
knows that, yes, you can derive
tremendous support from those.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Like, you got this, baby.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You can go.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And you're like, yeah.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I got this.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
She said I got this.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Feels great to finish something
and share with someone,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
share a meal, get the hug.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But there's another
side to all of that

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
that I'd like to learn
more about from you,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
which is there's a
warm body next to you

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
in bed in the morning.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You don't want to get up.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
They also have needs.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
You've got your mission
that people sometimes

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
need things from us.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But also, oftentimes,
the people that

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
love us most, that truly love
us and that want to support us,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
don't understand this thing.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And they're the first people
to tell us, like, listen.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Take a day off.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And then this whole cycle,
at least in my head,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
goes off, like, you
just want a vacation.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And then it's almost
like a paranoia.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I'm not saying anything
nice about myself right now.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Former girlfriends

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
are going to be like, yeah.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Like, they remember that.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And so support of people
close to you is critical.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
This could be friends.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Could be romantic partners.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Whatever.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But they're also-- the
knife cuts both ways.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It can be the thing
that can really

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
undermine this thing that you're
talking about because people

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
that care about us also
want to see us comfortable.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
They want to see us happy.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
They want to see us peaceful.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
They want to see us wake up
from a great night's sleep.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And they want things too.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
So how do you untangle
that whole bit?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Well,
it's funny, man.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I'm unbalanced, but
I'm mostly unbalanced

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
towards the family side, which
people don't get about me.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I'll start being unbalanced.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I get all my stuff in.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
But what I do is I make sure
that my family has everything

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
they need, everything
they need, those who

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
want to be part of my family.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Some don't.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Some family members don't want
to be part of David Goggins.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I get it.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I got it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
That's life.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Those who are part
of my family, I

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
give them everything
they need so they

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
can leave me the fuck alone.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I make sure you're happy as fuck
because I got to go to work.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And I don't mean smokejumping.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I don't mean running.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I mean all of it.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
It takes every--

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I can't have you
in my fucking shit.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I can't.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So I know for me
to have a family,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I gotta make sure that you
realize I'm going to give you

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:44.000
everything you need.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So when you start
bitching at me,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I'm going to say, look, hang on.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I dedicated my life to give
you everything you need.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I need this time
right here for me

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
to be the best I can be
because this journey started

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
without anybody.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And I make sure everybody knows
that who comes in my life.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I've been left-- think about it.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I was left alone at a young
age to figure this shit out.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I figured it out for myself
and have been very successful

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
for myself.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
No one's going to come in
here and fuck with my shit.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
That's why I make sure I will
take care of whatever you need.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Whatever you need
from me, you got it.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Money, house, my
love, my support,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I'm going to give you
everything you need.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
That said, I do it the
highest level possible.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And I'm saying that with
Jennifer in the next room.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So please come here
and say something

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
if it's wrong, Jennifer.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I don't give a fuck.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Say what you got to say.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
So then when it's time
for me to go to work,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I expect you to
do the same for me

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
because it takes every bit of
me to do what I have to do.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
So I make sure that I'm very
unbalanced from my family

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
so I can be exactly that
unbalanced for myself.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And that's how I do it.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I let people know
right up front,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I'm not what you want in a man.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I guarantee that.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
There's going to be
a lot of late nights,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
a lot of early
mornings, a lot of times

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
where I got to be by myself
thinking about the process that

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
is next in my mind.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I can't have aggravation.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I can't have this.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Can't have that.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
There's a lot of things.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But I let them know up front.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I'm very vocal about that.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Sometimes relationships
work for me.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Sometimes they didn't.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But that's who I am.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
One thing I did wrong in my life
was I tried for so many years

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
to please people.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And I did it at the
expense of myself.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I was leaving a lot in the tank.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And when you do that,
you stop living.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
But the person in your
life is happy as fuck

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
because you're giving
them everything they want.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
They have their--
their life is full.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
But you feel empty.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And that's not a
relationship to me.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So for me, it's
important that you

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
know exactly who I am because
this is what life made.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And I'm not trying to change it
because I just figured it out.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
So I'm not trying to
compromise David Goggins.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I would never, ever
compromise David Goggins.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
That doesn't mean I won't
give you what you need

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
and what you want
and what you desire.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But I don't need money.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I don't need fame.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I don't need shit.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
So I give it all away.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
What I do need is to make sure
that that willpower is worked

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
on every fucking day and every
night for the rest of my life

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
because that's the
one thing that's

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
going to keep me feeding you,
keeping you where you need

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
to be, because once
that willpower is gone,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
300-pound David Goggins,
he may not look like it,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
but I will walk around with it.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
So the things that are
important to you in life,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
you must do always.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Or you're nobody.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And that's how I
handle relationships.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Something I could
personally work on

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
is that upfront,
clear communication

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
because it resonates that
feeling of there's something

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
inside that's not getting worked
out that, when I'm on my own,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
it's a lot easier.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
But then, of course, wanting
relationships and family,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I think that's a healthy
part of being human too.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And obviously,
you've worked it out.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So I appreciate
you sharing that.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I don't think I've
ever heard you

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
talk about it that way before.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
DAVID GOGGINS: People are
scared of that conversation

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
with their wife, husband,
girlfriend, boyfriend.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But why are you scared of it?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Why are you scared to tell
a motherfucker, your wife,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000
your husband, who you are, who
you are, exactly who you are?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And that was the problem
I had-- that's a problem

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
that a lot of us have in life.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
No one knows who you really are.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
No one knew who I really was.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I went to a school where there
were a lot of Black kids.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
A lot of Black kids didn't
want to be in special ops.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I never talked about
special ops to Black kids.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Why?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I was wondering what--

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I'm not going to fit in.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
That's not what they do.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
A lot of Black kids don't
do that kind of shit.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So whatever I wanted
to do, no one really

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
knew the real me growing up
because I never wanted anybody

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
to know the real me.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I was always afraid
of what you might say

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
or how you're going
to feel or whatever.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You got feelings.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
You have a life that
you have to live.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So it's important that
whatever's on your mind,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
you let that person know.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Therefore, you're
giving them the option

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
to be with you or not.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
This is who I am.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
If you don't like
it, that's good, man.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I got it.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
But this is David Goggins.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So that honest conversation
is very important, man,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
so everybody knows
where they stand.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
That person may not be for you.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And that's all good.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This world could

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
use a lot more of that upfront,
completely honest conversation.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I feel like so much of
the world's problems

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
are because everyone's
dancing around these issues.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Recently in the news,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
seeing people losing
their job because they

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
won't say something publicly.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You can tell they
kind of what it.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It's like, people just,
I think, deep down really

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
crave the direct message.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Like, what are you about?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:10.000
What are you not about?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
But I think now, everyone's
afraid of getting canceled.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
It's a big deal, getting
canceled, that people think,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
oh, I can't work
if I am who I am.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Or if I'm not pretending
to be somebody else,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
then silence is
considered agreement.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
There's all sorts of
complicated stuff.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And I do feel for the
generation coming up

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
because we didn't have
social media and all of that.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Again, just walled
off from that.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
There's a real benefit from
just not paying attention.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
People love to lie.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
People love to lie.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
You know, I thought
I was only a person--

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
when I was growing
up, I thought I

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
was the only person that lied
because I lived in a bubble.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And people love to lie
about who they're not.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
They love to lie about
who they're not, dude.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And that's, for me, the
reason why I'm so vulnerable,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
and I'm so real and honest.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Find somebody to
come out and tell me

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I'm lying about my fucking life.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And for me to come
where I came from

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and have the resume
I have now, you

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
know the confidence you get?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
How I don't care who--
you're going to-- you're

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
going to judge me?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You're going to judge me?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
What have you done in your life?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
So me, being so honest and
so upfront and so truthful,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
that came with me finally
figuring out who I was,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
but also conquering David
Goggins, the demons of David

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Goggins.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Therefore, now, you're
just an open book.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
You look at somebody, look
them right in the eye.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Tell me exactly who
the fuck you are.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
You walk away.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I'm good, bro, because I know
exactly what this journey took

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
to get here.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
And that gives you a fire
and a passion that people

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
can call you nigger,
they can call you--

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
if you're a lesbian or
gay or bise-- call me

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
whatever the fuck you want.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
If you put yourself in
the fire and you come out

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
every fucking day like this,
brush it off, not scared

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
to go back in there
again, come on, man.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Your truth is real.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You come out every
day, man, with a way

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
of talking to people that people
don't have because there's

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
no truth behind them.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And the truth is
the starting line.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
When you sit down the ugly
mirror and say, I'm this,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I'm this, I'm this and this,
you finally started your life.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Maybe 40 years old.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Maybe 40 years old,
five, six kids, wife.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But the second you look in that
mirror and you say, I'm this,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,
I'm this, well, basically,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm not this, I'm not this,
I'm not this, I can't do this,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I can't do this, I'm
all these insecurities,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
your life finally started.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And once you start that
life, man, the truth

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
comes out big time because
you no longer care.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So that's the problem.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Most people just don't want
to have that conversation

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
to the point where they can go
on stage and a million people

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
and say, I'm all of this.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And have a good day.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
See you.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It's empowering.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It's very empowering.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like the
way we're educated in school,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
but also outside of school, is
we're trained, as human being,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
as these young brains,
to try and figure out

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
how to get positive
feedback from other people.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
It's like we're little dogs.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
You have a bulldog.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:15.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I had a bulldog.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Saw the picture of your bulldog.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
She's great.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Charlie dog.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're
an amazing species.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
DAVID GOGGINS: They are.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
of them economy of effort

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
or amazing breed, excuse me.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
They're an amazing breed.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Economy of effort.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
They don't do anything
unless it's necessary.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
It's the exact opposite of
everything we're talking about.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It's kind of interesting.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And they're kind of hedonists.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Now, it is true that
they'll die to protect you.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's an instinct.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I saw that with Costello.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I'm sure that--

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I
saw it with Charlie.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Yeah.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's an instinct.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
But if they're not
in that position,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
if there's no need
to exert effort--

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:50.000
DAVID GOGGINS: They're resting.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So your bulldog's
resting for you.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Got it.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So you don't need
to rest because--

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Active
recovery Charlie.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:58.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:38:59.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
That's going to be your
answer from now on.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
People go, does he sleep?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Does he rest?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Go, no.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
He somehow worked it out so
his bulldog does it for him.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But we're sort of

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
indoctrinated into
this way of being

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
from a time that we're
young, where, of course,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
praise feels good.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Someone tells you, hey, I like
that shirt, or good job today,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
or nicely done.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Or for me, because growing up
in a big pack of friends growing

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
up, and I was never the greatest
athlete, wasn't terrible,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
wasn't great, et cetera, like,
a fist bump, or, like, feeling

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.000
crewed up.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And you're just like, yeah.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
But you've talked about
this before in reference

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
to the SEAL Teams.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
We both know a lot of
people in that community.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And the Teams component is a big
part of it for a lot of people.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And it's a wonderful thing.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But there's a danger
to that dopamine hit,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
for lack of a better
way to put it,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.000
from we can only derive when
it's coming from the outside.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You're talking about being
able to either say, good job,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
but also, just look to one's
own personal history and say,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I've done hard things.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And I can do it again and again
because I do it again and again

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and again.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.000
You're talking about parenting
yourself, inspiring yourself,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
scaring yourself, all
of that from the inside.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So very different
than the way we're

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
raised, which is to figure
out how to get the biscuit.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.000
People want to know how
I'm always motivated.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
It's the unseen work, which you
just said is a true statement.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Those are false dopamine
hits that people

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
are giving you, man.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
There's no belief in that.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
These are teamwork
dopamine-- like, I'm out

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
running at 2 o'clock
in the morning, 1

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000
o'clock in the morning in the
gym, long sessions by myself.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
That's real.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I'm able to extract dopamine,
the good dopamine whenever

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I want.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Man, I've trained
99% of my life alone.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
No one patted me on the back.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I did all of the work alone.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
And while I'm still hard on
myself, I know what I did.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
So whenever times
get bad for me,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
people are all this, who's going
to carry the boats and lo--

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
that's real.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I hate that people
know me for that guy

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
because that guy is
not every fucking day.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
When they see me,
they want that energy.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
That's not me every day.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I can extract it
immediately when I need to

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
because when you train alone--

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
and I lived alone for so
many years in this misery.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And you're able to
get out by yourself.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I can take myself to such
a level of real passion

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and purpose.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And the feeling I
get is something

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I can't even explain by mys--

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't need anyone.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
That's why people come
to me to motivate them.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
No one can motivate me.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I have a resume full
of fucking motivation

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
that whenever I'm down, I'm
like, oh hang on, motherfucker.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Oh, you know the truth.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
You know the truth.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You know the darkness
of the fucking dungeons

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
and the fucking demons that fly.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And then from there,
it's like, OK.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
You were there.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You know this.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
There was no one
there to pick up

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
the rucksack, to pick
up the boat, to pick up

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
the log, to go in there.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
It was you.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:20.000
It was you.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
There was no pat on the fucking
back at 300, at 275, at 250,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.000
at 220.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
No.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
That was you.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
So those things
that come out of me,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
that extract from me
in the darkness, people

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
are looking for that
pat on the back.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Where is it?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Oh, I don't need it
because what I've done

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
is in the fucking unseen work.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I built Frankenstein.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So whenever shit gets
nasty, David Goggins

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
goes, you had nobody
anyway, motherfucker.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
So see how I'm talking
to myself right now?

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
That's me.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
That's shit fires
me the fuck up.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
That shit makes me fucking nuts.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
You had nobody
anyway, motherfucker.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Look around you.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
There was no fucking team.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
It was you.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
There was no weight loss program
or mom and dad waking you up,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
saying you can do it, you can be
better, trying to build belief.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
You built belief
when you had nothing.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Rock bottom.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.000
You did that.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
So as times get hard for
me, the truth comes out.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
And my truth is
powerful as fuck.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It's real.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's tangible.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I feel it.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It comes out of my brain
as I speak about it.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I'm reliving every single dark
moment of my life to be here.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
So that is what
people don't get.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
That is what motivates David
Goggins is the unseen work.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But everybody needs
that pat on the back.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
They need that training partner.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000
They need that
accountability coach.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I don't need that shit.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And neither do they.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But it's what we've
trained ourselves

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
to believe that we need.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
almost like there's

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
this pill on the shelf.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I'm speaking in analogy.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And we take it, and
we get jazzed up.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And we're like, yeah.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But there's this other
medicine cabinet behind there.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And it's in us.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
You're saying the real
medicine cabinet is inside.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
When you continue to overcome--

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
and I had so many
obstacles to overcome.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So it's actually
a benefit to me.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
But the benefit, it's not
like a benefit like that.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You have to have the
courage and the patience

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
to overcome and overcome.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Before you know it, man, you
have a whole medicine cabinet.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
But there's no medicine
in the motherfucker.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
There's no pre-workout.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I don't take none of that shit.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
All I got to do
is flip my brain.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Put my finger in there and
say, OK, that's a good one.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
It's all I got to do, man.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I got the Rolodex.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I'm just like, go fuck
yourself, Goggins.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And oh, but you won.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Let's do that one today.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
There's nothing I need.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And this is the
thing that people

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
don't get about David Goggins.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I can't teach it in
a 1-minute video.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000
We all have this ability to
have our own medicine cabinet.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
But unless you go in there
and put the medicine in there,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
it's always going to
be fucking empty, man.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
You're always going to
need the pre-workout.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
You're always
going to need the--

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I don't drink coffee.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I don't do ca--

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I don't do none of that.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I don't need it.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I can run for 70 hours, and
I have before, no caffeine.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I got all this wonderful shit
that I overcame on my own,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
by myself, in the darkness,
that, man, when it's cold,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I'm hot.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
When it's hot--

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I can feed myself all the time.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
That's why when people
say, man, why aren't you

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
missing anything, I can't
explain it to you, man.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Can't explain it to you.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
You'll never understand.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
That's why I don't do
all these podcasts, dude.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I love you, man.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
That's why you-- my first
book, you did a blurb for me.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
That's why I'm here.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I love what you're
doing for people, man.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But I can't explain this.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I can't.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I can't explain this because
people don't want to do this.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
They don't want to do this, man.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
But I don't know, man.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I get jazzed up even
talking about it,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
man, because so many people
think my life is just so, oh

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
god, his life is horrible.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Don't follow him.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:30.000
He's crazy.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Really?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But there
are a good number of people,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I would say, and that's an
under-- that actually do.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I think what I'm hearing today,
and it's really sinking in, is

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
that a great many people
either partially or completely

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
misunderstand you.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll put myself
in the partially category.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Big time.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Because I thought

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
it was about just forward
center of mass, carrot, carrot,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
carrot, carrot.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But it's the stick.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's being haunted.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And you know, I do have examples
from my own life, which is not

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
what today is about,
about being really afraid

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
and then turning things around.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
My biggest fear is
getting comfortable.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I do not have as much of
a stick-oriented approach.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
But today's conversation's
changing the way I think.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I'm not going to
step away from this

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and think, OK, there are
25 neural circuits that

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
can explain 10 of the things
that David's talking about.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And what I'm thinking
about is the fact

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
that everybody has a brain.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
They have a mind.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Forget the brain.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
The brain's just the
physical structure.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But what that manifests, what
that creates is the mind.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And everybody has that.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So I do believe that
everyone has the capacity

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
to do what you're talking
about at some level.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I also will be the
first to confess

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
that I think you
are highly unusual.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Let's just say maybe even n
of 1, as we say in science.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Sample size of one.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Somebody who has created
this process for themselves

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
and keeps them in
this-- themselves

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
in this forward center
of mass with the stick

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
battering the back of
their head all the time.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Highly unusual.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
But this internal
medicine cabinet

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
that you're talking
about building up,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
true confidence, not needing
anything from the outside,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I like to think that
people want that.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
They want to be known.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
They're afraid.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
But that they want to be
known for who they really are

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
and that you're describing
the path to do this.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And I will say I'm immensely
grateful that you're

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
talking to us this
way today about things

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
that you've talked about before.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
But we're hitting it a little
differently, I like to think.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
what you're talking about

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
is a process.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It's verbs.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
It's all verbs.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
DAVID GOGGINS: All action.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it's not about success.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
It's more, actually,
about keeping

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
that friction dialed to 10.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And no energy drink,
no supplement.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
People often misunderstand me.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
They think-- like, I'm big
on people getting sunlight

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
in the morning so they
set their circadian rhythm

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
and get better sleep and
so they can-- et cetera.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
But then people always
think-- they go straight

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
to the supplements.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
What should I take?

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And then, of
course, people think

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I'm all about supplements.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
And supplements are
one piece for me.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But it's like tiny fraction
compared to the doing,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
the do's and don'ts.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
That's why I didn't

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
want to talk about that today.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
That's why I'm glad
we're talking about this.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
This is it.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
This is it.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Like, the brain is the most
powerful weapon in the world.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And it's crazy how a kid
that wasn't real smart,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I was forced to
go only internal.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
External had to go away.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
The external world
had to go away.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000
In living so deep inside
myself, it was me in this brain

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
and figuring out how
this thing works.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And so many people are doing
exactly that, the supplements,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
the this, the that.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
And I agree, it helps.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.000
But once you figure
out your brain,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
you become unstoppable
to almost anything.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Yeah, you can't beat death.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
You can't whatever, whatever.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Your brain is amazing.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Once you feed it the right
conversation, the right mental

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
nutrients, the right
mental supplements,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
the right internal
dialogue at the right time

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
with the right hit, with the
right proof of what you've

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
done in the past, and
you send that right

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
to the right circuit, dude,
you're a fucking beast.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
A beast.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000
But once again, you just
can't read about it.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
You can't sit back
and be a theorist.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
You have to be a
fucking practitioner.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And in that practice is where
that becomes proof-positive

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
of what I'm saying.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
It's like, god, David
Goggins is blowing my mind.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
What is this?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
He's not crazy.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:09.000
And so many people,
a lot of people,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
have listened to
me the right way.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And they come back, and they're
like, I'm totally on board.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
It happened.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:16.000
It happened.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I'm like, it'll keep going,
man, if you keep doing it.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
But that is it, man.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
There's no sun.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
There's no glory.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
There's no carrot.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
There's no victory.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
But there is all of it in one.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I just can't explain it
real well to people, man.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
But what you get the
other end is something

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
that you're always found.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
You're never lost anymore.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Doesn't mean the
journey is easy.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Doesn't get any easier.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
But you're always found.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I just want to hover
on that for a sec

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
the same way we hovered
on haunted and the stick.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I think people feel lost.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I've certainly felt lost at
times in my life, many times.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And yeah, there's that thing.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I don't think there's a
neuroscience or a psychology

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:04.000
term for it.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Someone will put it in the
comments and say, oh yeah,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
that's what so-and-so said.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
But like you said, we're not
trying to be theoretical here.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
We're trying to be practical.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
The business of finding
yourself and knowing, oh.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
But it's sort of like I'm
safe because I'm in danger,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
and I've been in danger
before, and I got myself out.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
It always seems to
come back to verbs.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Again, I don't have
a language for this.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
For once, I'm lost for words.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
There's like-- it's about
a process, the algorithm.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And the reason-- here, I'm just
kind of trying to make sure

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I'm understanding
things correctly.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
One of the reasons why
it must be uncomfortable

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
for you to be who
you are publicly

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
is because people want to focus
on the running or the swearing.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And by the way, the
swearing is welcome.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'll tell you, I came
up through laboratories

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
where all three people I
worked for swore a lot.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
But there was one rule.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I couldn't swear at people.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
So my graduate advisor,
brilliant woman,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
unfortunately, she died
early, they all died early--

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I'm the common denominator.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I had that internalized
for a long time.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Anyway, she said, but if you
swear at people, you're out.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
But you can swear
as much as you want.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So that's the rule I have.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It's like, you can swear
as much as you want.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Just don't swear at people.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And if you swear at people,
better be ready to fight.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Definitely not
going to fight you.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
So you can swear at
me, get away with it.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000
But the fact of the
matter is that it must

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
be frustrating that people--

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
because I know
people go, oh, it's

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
all about supplements
and ice baths.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Listen, I like supplements.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I love supplements
and ice baths.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
But that's not the full picture.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
It's just a gravitational pull.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
It's the swearing.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
It's the running.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
It's his feet that
are all messed up.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
It's the fact that
he got a Triton.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
He's a SEAL guy.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Talk about that too.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And there's a gravitational
pull for people.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And they're missing-- that's
the tip of the iceberg,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:53.000
is what I'm realizing.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I'm realizing that
today thanks to the way

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
you're phrasing things
because the bigger vessel

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
is all in here.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And as you said, how do
you put that in a book?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
it's highly individual.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
You do it your way.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And you're saying,
everyone needs

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
to go figure out how to
do it their way for them.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And the thing about
being misunderstood,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
it's very frustrating, more
than I can even imagine.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
I can't even express
how frustrating

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.000
it is when the cussing
and everything comes

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
from a place of real.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I can't explain what
I do without it.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
The passion comes out of me.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
It's almost like speaking in
tongues because when you put

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
that much work-- and
people go, oh yeah,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
there's been this basketball
player, this football player,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
this--

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
dude.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
No.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
No.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Everything, everything is work.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Everything.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And people don't believe it.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:59.000
So when I speak, the
motherfucker and the fuck

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:05.000
and the shit, that is
what it took for me,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:15.000
what it takes for me, the anger,
the passion, the jaw-dropping--

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
just it takes that
because I'm not that.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
This is how I look at it, man.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
What built this guy?

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Let's imagine being
in the coldest

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
water you can possibly take.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
I always go back to
Hell Week with this.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I hated that water.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Hated it.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
You're sitting there locked
arms, and you're in the water

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
all the time.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
And they're bringing you
in and out of the water,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
in and out of the water.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
When you have this
dialogue in your head,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and these people are judging me
off a freaking 1-minute video,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
and you're constantly
your whole life,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
when you figured it out
at 24, that I got to--

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I just got to, just
fucking got to,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and this is just going to suck.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Every day it's going to suck.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And live like that to be better.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
And I put it this way.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I'm in the water.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
The water is going over my
head, the Pacific Ocean.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
It's freezing.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
February.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Cold as shit.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Been through three Hell Weeks.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
For you to constantly
win, win, win,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
when this voice over
here, the real you,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
is saying get the fuck out
of here, go, you're nobody.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
You've always been nobody.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
And it's true.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
People don't hear that.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
That's a true voice.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That's a real reality of
David Goggins at 24 years old.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
It's not a false reality.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And then you had to create
another voice over here that

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
is saying, you're better
than that other voice.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And you're in the
freezing cold water

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
that both voices don't
want to fucking be in.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
But you win.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Then goes from the
water to the studying

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
to the running to
the losing weight

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
to how you eat to how
you function as a man.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Every day of your life,
you're winning these battles.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.000
And then I have normal people
who only have one voice.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Never created the second voice.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
The winning voice
is the second voice.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
They have one voice.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And that's just,
I'm a piece of shit.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And that's all they hear.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And then they judge
people like me

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
who are out here
trying to be better.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
It's something that
I can never really--

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
it's a frustrating
thing for me because I

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
know the majority of people.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I know what goes on in the
brain because I studied the mind

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
more than almost-- more than
you because I'm a practitioner.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
So for you to be a piece of
shit and come out of that,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
you don't just come out of it.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
You spend decades studying
your mind and the human mind

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
on how it functions in good
environments, bad environments,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
stressful environments,
patient environments.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
You study it all because
you had to put all this

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
together to create the
mind to become successful.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
So I had to-- it wasn't like
God blessed me with this brain.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I had to create a mind.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
And so in doing
so, I figured out

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
every piece of shit
human being in the world

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
because that's what I was
going off of for myself.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
So I know why you
go on Instagram.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I know why you-- because
you just have the time.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
You have the time
because you don't

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
want to put that time
into bettering oneself.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
So I know why I'm misunderstood.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I'm misunderstood by people
who have plenty of time

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
on their hands to misunderstand
me because they are exactly

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000
where I once was, which is a
low-life, lazy piece of shit.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
And it's the harsh reality
of people who troll you,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
who go after you.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
They have nothing better
to do with their lives.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It's not some after
school special.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
It's the truth.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000
But I once was that way.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I know where it all comes from.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
That's why it's
frustrating to me

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
now because I'm not so
frustrated at the fact

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
that I'm being trolled.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I'm frustrated by
the fact that you

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
don't have the
courage, the courage

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
to try to be somebody
better than what you're not.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
And that's the frustrating part.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's interesting

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
because earlier, we were
talking about relationships.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
And you said, in
a very candid way,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and I really appreciate
you sharing that,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
that you make sure
that the people close

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
to you, your family,
has everything they need

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
and that they also
understand that you're

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
going to take what you need to
continue to build you period.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Period.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
In some ways, it

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
seems you've also included the
general public in that family.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
You're saying, listen, I'm
going to give you what you need.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I'm going to give you as
much of myself as I can,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
except I'm going to
stop right at the line

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
that if I were to
cross it is going

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
to prevent me from
continuing to build myself.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
And by the way,
this relationship

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000
only exists because I
don't cross that line.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.000
And I think as much as there
are detractors out there

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
or people that try--

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I mean, whatever they're doing
is pretty feeble, in my mind.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I mean, it's like cap
gun fire, it that.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,
men and women, old and young,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
hear something and feel
something in your message.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Like, yeah, it
seems kind of crazy.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Gosh.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Doesn't he ever just relax?

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
What about his sleep?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Look at his feet.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
He's going to-- he's
going to injure himself.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Listen, I'll be very direct.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I got friends who were in the
Teams who just go, what's he

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
going to do when he can't run?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And I know the answer
is keep running.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
it's more comfortable

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
for people, even
high achievers--

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Especially
high achievers.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to
believe that if you

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
took one thing away, that
it would all go away.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
It's absolutely clear that's
not the case with you.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I'm 100% convinced.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I just know that because
we're talking about this.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:14.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Do you
know how many times

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I haven't been able to run?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Two heart surgeries.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Multiple knee surgeries.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And after every knee
surgery, they said,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
you're not going to run again.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And I'm fine with that.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
There's no running up here, bro.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
None.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
This was what it was all about.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
That's what they lost.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
What if you can't run?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Give a fuck.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It was never about running.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Why do you think I run?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
It's the worst thing.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I hate doing it
more than anything.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Hence the willpower.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Your anterior
mid-cingulate cortex

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Hence the willpower.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--would start to regress

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
if you loved running.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Every day, I wake up.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I don't just run
a mile, two miles.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
It's the one thing I
hate the most to do.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And I do it like I love it.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
250, 260, 300-mile
runs at one time.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
No sleep.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And every step, when I get
to the-- think about this.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I get to the fucking start
line cussing at Jennifer.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Why the fuck am I here?

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I hate this shit.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
After 70-some hours of
running, every fucking

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
question I ever had is answered.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Every question I
had is answered.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I capped success.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
People go, what do you
mean, you capped success?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
For me to be who I am--

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.000
so when I go smokejump, I smoke
jump three to four months out

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
of the year, sometimes five.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could
you, just for those

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
that aren't educated
about-- just

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
give us a brief description
of what smokejumping entails.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.000
DAVID GOGGINS: So basically,
you jump into fires.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Not into them, but you jump by
fires that people can't get to.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out
of planes and helicopters.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Right, out of planes.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I parachute.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It's all parachuting.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So you parachute
out of airplanes.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And then you fight the fire, you
and sometimes four other guys

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
or maybe eight other
guys, guys and gals.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And you're putting
this fire out.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.000
So I lose millions of dollars
every summer to do this.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It blows people's minds.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Why the hell are you doing this?

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
you're breathing soot.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
DAVID GOGGINS: I'm
breathing soot.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Knees are jacked up.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Hitting the ground.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Hurting.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Whatever.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Talking to normal people,
they'll never get it,

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
so I don't even
explain it to them.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
But this is why-- this is
why I call it capped success.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I'm talking financial success.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000
For me to continue having that
willpower, the second I just

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
become a speaking
monkey and travel around

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
and speaking gigs 12
months out of the year,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000
put camps on, do this, put on
lectures, get supplement lines

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
and do this and write
more books and shit,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I've ruined the exact thing
I worked on my entire life.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And while I didn't
know it until the day,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
but something
always told me, this

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
is a very, very, very
perishable skill, this willpower

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
that you have, because I do have
a willpower that I have never

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
seen in anybody in my life.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
It is a haunting force
that just keeps me going.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
And I know that
that is my strength.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
If you have that-- so that's
worth every dime I've ever

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000
made in my life is the fact
I can look a man in the eye

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
finally and have a
real conversation

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
without going like
this because I'm lying,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
or I'm a piece of shit.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Or I know-- you
know how a person--

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
and so many people do this shit.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
They're talking to you
on who they want to be.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
They're lying to you.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
And they walk away--

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I've done it so many times.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
You walk away like, god, man.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
If I could just
tell them the truth.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Why the hell can't I
just tell him the truth?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Know how good it
feels for me now

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000
to look at you in
your eye and every man

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I see because women
won't get this.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Women will not get this.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Man to man, that
man shit, when you

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
look another man
in the eye, and you

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
know that everything you're
fucking saying is real,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
and it comes from a real
working place, something

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
that you earned, it's the
best feeling in the world.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can
say that actually happened.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Like, I know with certainty what
I'm saying actually happened.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Actually happened.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Who I am and who
I say I am, I am.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
No more lies.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
No more skirting the truth.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
No more bullshit.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And that is worth every dime
I've ever made in my life.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
And I swear to God on that.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Every dime I've ever made in
my life, building who I built,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
so I capped success
because I know

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
that if I ever go 12
months out of the year

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
and don't put several--
every day, I'm going at it.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
But several months
out of the year,

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I go right back to
ground zero, which means

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I'm just fucking David Goggins.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
No Goggins.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
No carry boats,
fucking logs bullshit.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.000
It's just pick up that
fucking Pulaski and dig.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Hey, get that fucking pump.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Walk down a mile.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Put it in the fucking water.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Mosquitoes beating--
you're just David Goggins.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
You're nobody because
that's where my growth is.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
That's where my
willpower comes from.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
And that's where it stays.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
That's why when I talk to
you now-- and can't nobody

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
talk like this, dude.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
People don't talk with
this kind of passion

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
because it ain't there.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
It ain't there.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
They're regurgitating some
shit from 30 fucking years ago.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I'm regurgitating
shit from an hour ago.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Hour ago.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Come on, man.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
It's just be real.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
And I can't be on
these podcasts.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I can't talk to anybody
without being real.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I'll go away.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I'll just go away
because I can't give you

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
what I want to give you.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
said perishable skill.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I think that's
another set of words

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I want to highlight because
skill implies behavior.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
And when we were just
talking a second ago

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000
about the deep, true bedrock
sense of confidence that

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
comes from looking
someone in the eye

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
and telling somebody
something that you absolutely

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
know it's true
because it happened,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
you're talking about actions.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Not talking about perceptions.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
You're not talking about
what you believe happened.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
You know it happened.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And there's something really
concrete about actions.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I mean, that's what's
so interesting is

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
we're talking about the mind.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
But actions are the
manifestation of the mind.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And the stuff that just stays
in here, people die with that.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
It doesn't go anywhere.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Long ago, somebody said--

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I forget what the context was.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
It was a neuroscientist.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
He said, most emotions,
they're just emotions.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
They're just in there.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
You don't have to do
anything with them.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And I think certain emotions
you want to do something with.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
But I think people forget this.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
They feel miserable,
like they're

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
going to dissolve into a
puddle of their own tears.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
No one ever died
from an emotion.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
But they feel-- they overwhelm
us as if it's a tidal wave.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
It's going to pull us
under and drown us.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
It's so interesting to me
because I think what people--

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
listen, you have a
gravitational pull.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
People can feel the energy.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I think, yes, you're
either completely badly

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
or partially understood.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
There's only one
guy on the planet

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
that truly understands you.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I think there's one
woman, Jennifer,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
who probably understands you
as much as anyone's going to.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And then the rest of us
are kind of grasping,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
trying to figure it out.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
But you're saying, go inward.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000
So first, go inward.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
And then it's actions.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Inward and actions.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Now, the inward
piece is something

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I'd like to just spend a little
bit of time on because there

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
are a couple of characters
from history, people that

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
were in concentration camps.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Nelson Mandela.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I mean, I'm not sure he
had Instagram in there.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I'm pretty sure he didn't.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And I don't think there
was anyone coaching him on,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
hey, you're going
to get out someday.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
And actually, you're going
to lead an entire country.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I'm pretty sure that's
not how it worked.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
He had to find it here.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
He had to find it
between his ears.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And there are other examples.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
But that's an important one.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.000
So the process of going
inward, does it, for you--

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
and here, I will
ask for suggestions

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
because I think people want--

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.000
there are those of us who
want to build this skill.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Wall yourself off.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Phone off for big portions
of the day, perhaps.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Texting off.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000
The requests, the
this, the that.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Anyone that knows you
knows that-- we've

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
communicated a few
texts, but most of it

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
comes through a filter.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
She's great.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
She knows you.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And she knows how to
protect your time.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
DAVID GOGGINS: And that
hurts people's feelings.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
People get mad about that.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Hey, God bless--

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
God bless you, Jennifer.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Cutting oneself off,
when you're in there,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
you say it's just you.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000
And the voices that come
up are not pleasant.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000
And then at some point,
it converts to action.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
OK.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
What is the process
of picking the action?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
That's the piece that
I feel like there's,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
like, a bridge to build here,
if you can, if you would.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
DAVID GOGGINS: So the action
being, like, what's next?

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, so when you

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
go to sleep at night,
when that happens,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
you know what you're
going to do the next day?

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It's pre-planned?

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:35.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
It's always the same thing.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're
not building it on the fly.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:39.000
DAVID GOGGINS: No.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Nothing's on the fly.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
So how it works
internally for me is I'll

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
put it exactly how it is.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I'm an artist.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
And every day, I'm
painting Mona Lisa.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Every day.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And but it's a different one.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
It's not the same painting.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
So every day I wake up, even
though I'll do the same thing,

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
it takes a different
way to get there.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
So every day, in my mind,
I'm going through my mind.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I'm just like-- and a good
painter will not just paint.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
He needs to create.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000
And you can't create with
phones and everything

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
going around you.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
So you got to
block yourself off.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
You only do two
podcasts in a year.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
You block yourself off.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And you're painting
this thing inside.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
And you're going through
all these different colors

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
of paint and everything else.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And you can only figure
out the right painting

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
if you spend the correct
amount of time in your brain.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
So every single
day, I'm literally

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
going through my mind,
and I'm painting.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I'm creating this masterpiece.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
And the masterpiece
is always myself.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
And but to do that, you
cannot have any distractions

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
because if you're talking to an
artist and he's trying to think

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
about the next
painting, he can't.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
It's impossible to
listen to you and listen

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
to what your mind and body
are telling you we must do.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Because people
don't do enough of.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
They don't do any of it.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
They don't have passion.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
They lack passion,
drive, determination

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
because you haven't
spent time with yourself.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Your mind will tell
you what is next.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000
But you haven't
spent the time to go,

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.000
all right, let me
just figure this out.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000
You're looking for let me Google
this, and let me Google that,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
and let me-- you're not
going to find it there

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
because there's billions
of people in this world.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000
And they're all supposed
to be individuals.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.000
But we have a pack mentality.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
That's why you're
so fucking lost.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Why am I so unique?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I'm being exactly what the
fuck I was supposed to be.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
I ain't follow shit.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
And when I did follow shit,
I was like everybody else.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
The second I said, OK, man, hang
on, dude, you don't like this,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
you don't like this, you
don't like this, who are you,

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
David Goggins?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Who are you supposed to be?

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Miraculously, all
these things just--

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I couldn't even-- the list of
shit I had to do, just, wham.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
It's like, fuck.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
OK.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Wow.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Once you sit down with
yourself and say, OK, I

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
don't want to be like
Michael Jordan or Jim Brown--

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
they're both born
on my birthday.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
So I looked at their birthday.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I said, oh, maybe I
can be one of the--

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I can't.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'm going to be David
fucking Goggins.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And that looks like this.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
It just came.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Everything flooded.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
So every single day
of my life, there's

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
a different thing that
comes up that I have to do.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
But no one knows what to do
because everybody else is

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
following steps.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Like the Republican
and Democratic parties.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I'm not political--

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
DAVID GOGGINS: --at
all for this reason.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Republicans are going
to vote Republican.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Democrats are going
to vote Democrat.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
You're not even a human
fucking being, bro.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
No way all you fuckers agree
with all the same fucking shit.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
And I know I don't.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000
So once you figure out
yourself and who you are,

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
all the answers come.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
So every night, a different
painting is being painted.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
And it's a beautiful
painting for myself.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I'm like, OK.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:23.000
That's it.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
It may look the same
to most motherfuckers.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
But the end result is
very fucking different.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000
That's why my-- if you look
at what I've done in 49 years,

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
it's more than most people
will ever do in their life

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
because they were
a race car driver.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
And that's what they did.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
They drove a fucking car.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
It's great.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I was all kind of shit
because that's exactly what

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
the painting was saying to do.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
It's what the mind
was saying to do.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Wasn't saying just drive a car,
so then that race car driver

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
didn't know what the fuck to do.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.000
He retires from being a race
car driver, and they're lost.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
People go, how are you still--

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I don't get it.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Dude, you're never
going to fill your list.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But you never found your
list because it never

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
was presented in front of
you because your head was

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000
cluttered with shit because
you never just stopped

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.000
for lots of minutes, lots
of years, and just said,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
all right, it's me and you.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Let it go.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
And it just-- bam.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
It's right there.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
It's right there.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
not a psychologist,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
as I mentioned before.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.000
But I'm going to venture
a hypothesis here.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I think that you've mastered the
process of internal dialogue.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
But when I say dialogue, I
think most people think, oh,

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
the inner voice, the chatter.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
But that's just one
half of a dialogue.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
A dialogue is a two-way street.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So I completely agree because
I know from experience

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
that when we go inward,
oftentimes, we hear things,

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
if we're really honest with
ourselves, it's like, oh no,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I don't want to
think about that.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:05.000
No.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
And then we start
looking outward.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Or we start trying to shift
our attention or distract.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
And there are a
million reasons that

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
are handed to us, excuses, and
seemingly good justifications

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
to be able to do that.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
But dialogue is
a two-way street.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
And it hit me
while you were just

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
saying what you
were saying, I was

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
paying very close attention.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And I realized David Goggins
is talking about the voice that

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
comes up, including the
terrible stuff that no one wants

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
to hear about themselves
from themselves.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000
But then he's also got
the dialogue down where

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
he knows the counter voice.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
He goes, yeah, you're right.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
And so I'm going to do this.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Or maybe no, remember this.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.000
You're in a dialogue, a
two-way dialogue in there, not

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
a one-way chatter dialogue.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
There are books written
by famous psychologists

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
about chatter, trying to
shift your internal narrative.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
You're like, bring
the internal--

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
the internal narrative, that's
what going inward is about.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
But it's not one voice.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Again, there's a hypothesis.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000
And I'm not claiming
to be all-knowing.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Lord knows I'm not all-knowing.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
But you've mastered
the dialogue.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000
And if there are three voices,
strong, medium, and weak,

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.000
in there, you're like,
let's all come to the table.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000
So you've got a symphony
of voices in there

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
that are all you, that
you know to be you.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
And you know how to have
those convers-- you're not

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
afraid to be in
those conversations.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And then you know what the
outcome of that committee

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
decision is, and you put
it into real-world action.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
And the world only
sees the action.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And only you can

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
know your internal dialogue.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
And only I can know
my internal dialogue.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
And the only way to,
quote unquote, "know it"

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
is to spend a hell
a lot of time there.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:51.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Like, think about it.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
For me to be sitting
here in front of you,

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
you're not going to
call 300-pound Ecolab

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
guy to come sit here.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:03.000
You might.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I don't know.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Maybe.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Think about this.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:16.000
What we teach people is
kind, kindness to yourself.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Do you think if I
taught myself kindness--

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
and I agree with it.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
God, so many people-- so many
people take me out of context,

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
it's ridiculous.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Take it however the fuck
you want to take it.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:30.000
When I was 300
pounds, where do you

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
think that conversation
would that got me

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
if I spoke kindness to myself?

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I'll tell you where it gets me.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Right back to 7-Eleven with
another box of mini chocolate

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000
donuts and a
chocolate milkshake.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
That's the one voice.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
That's the one voice
that most of us have

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
that you're talking about.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.000
If you don't have a conversation
in there, the other voice

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:56.000
that you create that says,
OK, how does this look?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Looks very ugly.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
That kind conversation for
me went away a long time ago,

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
which is why the dialogue
is now what you see.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
A lot of action.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Because most people have
inaction because there's

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
one person talking.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
And that one person
is always leading you

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
down the same
path, the path that

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000
makes you feel very comfortable
and happy with yourself.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
The second you create the
other voice, there's conflict.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Just battles.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Just wars.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Just defeat.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
One thing I learned, and
I taught myself this,

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
and people go, I don't
understand what you're saying,

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I'm going to try to
break it down real quick.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I didn't teach
myself victory first.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I taught myself failure.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I taught myself how to fail.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And people like,
that's so depressing.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Is it?

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
When you're 300 pounds and
you can't read and write

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
and you're fucked up,
you know how many times

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
you're going to fucking
fail on that process?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000
So if you don't know how to
fail, there is no victory.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I never talked about
winning because I

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000
knew the path to
winning was going

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
to be years of failing first.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
So I taught myself
how to fail properly.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.000
No one teaches you
how to fucking fail.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
But if you're going out
for insurmountable fucking

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
odds that make absolutely
no fucking sense,

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
a Black kid that can't
swim, 300 pounds--

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
going to be a Navy SEAL.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
OK.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
You better teach yourself
how to fail first

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000
because if you sit in
failure for too long,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
you will never come out of it.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.000
So the first part
of my success was

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
learning how to fail properly.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.000
And then eventually, I started
getting a few victories.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
But that's what
people don't get.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:59.000
When you have buried yourself
in such a deep fucking hole,

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
you better first talk
about the failures

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:01.000
you're going to have first.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And that's when that
other voice comes up.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
It tells you, we've
got to do something.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:07.000
But it also tells
you, boy, I'm not

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
going to lie to you, Goggins.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
You're in for a
fucking climb, bro.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
You're going to get
your ass handed to you,

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.000
made fun of, the outside
noise, the inside noise.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Both voices are going
to be fucking telling

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
you to go fuck yourself.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
You are in for hell, bro.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I am.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
So I better learn to fail.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So this is what you

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
mean when you say that
whatever anyone says,

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
it's insignificant?

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Insignificant as fuck.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's the cap gun fire

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
because it's just like
it-- because the voice

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
in your own head is far worse.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And I should say, sorry, one
of the voices in your head.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I'm being very detailed,
almost surgical

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
about that because I think
this thing about inner dialogue

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
we think is one voice.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But you're making it
clear it's many voices.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
DAVID GOGGINS: It is.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And the thing about it is,
you have to be really--

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
and sometimes all the
voices are telling you

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
the wrong shit, man.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
But through years, years, not a
podcast or listening to a book

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.000
or reading a book,
years of sacrifice,

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000
of suffering, of diligent
pinpoint fucking work

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
on what you want
to do for yourself,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
not like, oh, let me
just do a bunch of shit.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Let me-- I want to be
in every task possible.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
No.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Pinpoint what I want
to do with my life.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
What happens is you have
all these voices that

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
are telling you
you're fucked up,

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
and this is going to be hard.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
But for some reason, you put
so much practice into you

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
that you can ignore
every one of them that

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000
are telling you you're not
going to fucking make it.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
And still be able
to fucking make it

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
because you have put
the practice in that you

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
know this is the process.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:04.000
It's such a daunting task that
all the voices are saying no.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
But you still have
the conviction

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
that I know I can do this.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.000
And that's what it took
for me to get here.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
20, 30 years ago, I had this--

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:21.000
35 or whatever it was,
25 years ago, pipe dream.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:27.000
And ever since then, every voice
was like, you're a fucking nut.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
But when you put that practice
in every day, you lace them up.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
And I mean, run.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
It's just a metaphor for life.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
When you lace them
motherfuckers up every day,

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
pretty soon, you win.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Pretty soon, you'll fucking win.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
If you have the courage and
the heart and the dedication

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
and the mindset of everybody
can go fuck themselves,

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I know what I know.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I've listened to
myself enough to know.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I know what I know.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
None of you can hear
what I'm hearing.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And that's what people
don't do enough of.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
They don't listen
to their journey.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
They listen to
everybody else's shit.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Before you know it, I'm crazy.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
But if I'm so fucking crazy,
why am I so successful?

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000
How that happen?

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
But I'm so misguided
and fucked up.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000
And don't listen to him.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Why am I the only one to
do a whole bunch of shit?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Why am I a trailblazer?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Why?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000
How is that possible?

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
How can you be fucked up and
also self-made at the same

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000
fucking--

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:29.000
no.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.000
No.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Obviously, you're not looking
at the truth in front of you.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000
The truth in front
of you is it sucks.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
It's painful.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
It's fucking mind-numbing.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
And that is the truth.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And that's why a
lot of people don't

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
like listening to me because
this is what it takes,

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
creating another voice and
sometimes going at it alone.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
All the time going at it
alone because no one's

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
going to believe in you.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
And that's that.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm
about to say is not conjecture.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000
And I can say that
with confidence

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.000
because I did a
four-episode guest

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
series with a brilliant
psychiatrist, a guy named

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Paul Conti.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000
He's from Trenton.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
He's a Stanford,
Harvard-trained guy.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.000
He's also got a lot
of street in him.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
He's had his own
hardship, real hardship.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.000
He's brilliant.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
And he said something
that I'll never forget,

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
which is, we think that
the forebrain, the part

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000
of our brain that creates
strategy, et cetera,

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
is the supercomputer.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
He said, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000
No, no, no.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
He's like, the
supercomputer of the brain

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
is the unconscious mind.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
It's the part of our mind that's
controlling most everything.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And most people,
unfortunately, don't

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
do the work to understand
how their unconscious is

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000
controlling them.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
And that's a scary
thing, this idea,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
like your mind is
controlling you.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
And I'm not going to get
into the free will debate.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I believe in at least some will.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I believe what you're describing
and this internal dialogue,

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
I think you have access
to your unconscious mind

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
by listening to the
dialogue, going inward.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
We know this is true in sleep,
in dreams, in meditation,

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
and just by shutting out
everything else, shutting out

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000
all the external
noise, which is filled

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
with things that pull us to it.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Noise makes it sound bad, but
it's the gravitational pull

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
of all the things that allow
us to distract ourselves

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.000
without knowing.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
The ice cream.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
The have a cookie.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
The Merry Christmas.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
The unconscious
mind, this huge piece

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
of the iceberg underneath that
Paul calls the supercomputer,

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
he's saying that with
knowledge as a neurobiologist,

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
psychiatrist, psychologist,
so he really knows,

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:41.000
that's the piece that if
one does real introspection,

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
he calls it the cupboards.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
You got to look
in the cupboards.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
And it's often really scary
what you find in there.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
And most people are
just like, I don't even

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000
want to know the
cupboards are there.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
But you're pulling all
the cupboard doors open.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
And then you're-- and you're
extremely deliberate with what

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
gets put into action.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
You're not just going,
oh, like, I'm pissed,

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
so I'm going to act pissed.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Or I'm tired, so I'm
going to act tired.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
It's you're picking very
carefully what to do.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
And that's a process that
I'm guessing came to you.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Does it come to you
as a, OK, it makes

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
sense why running makes sense.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000
It makes sense why
smokejumping makes sense.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000
So it seems like a huge
portion of your time

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
is spent understanding yourself
and making sense to you.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
And so when people
don't understand you,

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
it's got to be extra frustrating
because most people don't

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
understand themselves.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
So then we're all running
around going, you're this,

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
and you're that because
most people are just

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
unwilling to look inward.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
And I'm including
myself, by the way.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I mean, I've done a fair
amount of introspection.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But I'm inspired today, that
word, inspired, but it's true,

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000
motivated to start going inward
further because it is scary.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
It's like, we don't know
what's in those cupboards,

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
and it's terrifying, especially
because we don't know.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
DAVID GOGGINS: And those are
the first ones to open up.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
And like you talked
about, you got

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
to go through those cupboards.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I do spring cleaning
every fucking

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
day in those dark cupboards.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Those dark cabinets are the
ones I start with first.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
That's the real me, man.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:13.000
That's the real me.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
That's why I'm not ashamed.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I don't hide.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
I used to hide.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I don't hide anymore.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000
He's exactly right.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I don't know all the
fucking science behind shit.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I know what I know.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
That's why I don't listen
to anybody anymore.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I don't listen to shit.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I think most people are
full of shit because I know.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.000
I know the deep, dark secrets
of those fucking cupboards.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
It's ugly, man.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
And every day, I'm
talking to them.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Every day, I'm cleaning them.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
I'm cleaning them,
and I'm talking

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
to the same demons that came
out of those fucking cupboards

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
as I'm cleaning them.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Sometimes they go right
back in them again.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
It's not easy.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000
And this is why
most of us just--

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000
why I am misunderstood
because what comes out

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
of those cabinets
that I'm cleaning,

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
sometimes they see on Instagram.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Sometimes they'll
see it in a podcast.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Sometimes they see
it in this one.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I turn people off.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Open up your own cabinets.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
And then go talk about it.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Let me see how pretty it looks.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Let me see how pretty you sound.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Let me see how put
together your words are.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I bet you a fuck or a
motherfucker comes out

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
because for you to go
back in there again

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
to clean the same fucking
cabinet that the demon came out

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
of takes some big balls, bro.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000
To do it every day of your life.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:38.000
To go back in there and spring
clean every day, not once

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000
a fucking year,
once every decade.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Every day you know
it gets dusty.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.000
And every day, you don't
start with the victories.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
You don't go, oh, this is nice.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Look at my-- look at
my I love me wall.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Let me clean up.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000
This is a little dusty.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000
No.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I go right for the things that
are going to keep me buried.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
And I go right there first
because if I don't clean those

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
out first, the
day doesn't start.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
So what are you
saying to me is truth.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
And like I told you
many times today, I

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:13.000
can never figure out how to
explain this shit to people

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
because I'm not neuro nothing.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:21.000
I'm just a guy that said, OK,
we got to start in the dungeon.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.000
And we got to stay here
for the rest of our lives.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
For you to become
successful, the dungeon

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.000
is a place that has to be clean.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
And it's the
scariest place to be.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
That's why I'm
misunderstood because I'm

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
speaking from the dungeon.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
That's why I am
successful because I

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
go there every damn day.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000
And that is the
truth, what he says.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
It's the exact truth.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Those cabinets are
fucking dusty, dirty,

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
and scary as shit.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Broken glass, fucking
dark, spiders, cobwebs.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
But most of all,
your biggest fears,

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.000
the biggest things that put
you in a fucked up place you

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:05.000
are today are in there.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
That's why we all like
to keep them shut.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.000
You like to lock them up.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Act like they never happened.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
That's why you never grow.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
You never improve.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.000
You never have
real conversations

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
like we're having right now.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Never.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Never.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Oh no.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
No, no, no, no, no.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Let's not-- no, no, no.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Let's not go there.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I talked to so many
people who tell me that.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Let's talk about this.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Because they'll tell me, but
they can only say it once.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
And they'll say it in passing.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
They won't get deep
in the weeds with it.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Like, you can't just clean it.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Motherfucker, you got to
spit shine that motherfucker.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:45.000
You got to relive it,
every fucking detail of it.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
You can't just be like, oh
yeah, yeah, my dad beat me.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:51.000
And it is what it is.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
It ain't is what it
is, motherfucker.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
It's killing you.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
It's taken over your
whole fucking life.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
But that's the conversation.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Yeah, my dad beat-- but
I'm fine now, though.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I'm good.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
OK.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
All right.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:04.000
No, you ain't.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
You ain't fine.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
You ain't fine.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
This is real talk.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000
People don't have that.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So your boy's right.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
100% right.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Scary as shit.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
It's scary as shit.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.000
But it makes you who
you're supposed to be.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
And that's the test.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
We forget.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
We think we're supposed to
breathe air and have kids

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
and pay the bills and shit.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
But what's this life about?

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
That makes no sense.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
We're being tested, my friend.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Tests come when you
have not studied.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Tests come when you think
that you're in a great place.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
That's the test.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
The test is every
day of your life.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
And most of us fail
because we don't

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
know why we're here because
we don't go inward to say, oh.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
You gave me a lot
of shit to fix, man.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
And this test sucks.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
But then you start.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:07.000
ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I don't think I
could add to that.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I know I can't.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Thank you for sharing
what you shared today.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I mean, as much as your
process or anyone's process

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000
can't be completely
understood from the outside,

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
you gave us a real
window into this thing,

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.000
this process that you--

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
as you said, God put it on you.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I believe in God too.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
People can believe
what they want.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.000
But somehow, your life, God gave
you these challenges early on.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000
And then there was a point
where you went internal.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
And like you said,
you developed a skill.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
But it's a perishable skill.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000
And you clearly
live in the process

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000
of opening those cupboards,
reopening those cupboards,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
trying to spit shine
those cupboards,

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.000
understanding that they're
never, ever really done,

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.000
but that you can gain ground
on them, that you can win day

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
after day after day.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
And you really shared a
lot of concrete things

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.000
that I know people
are going to be

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
able to apply if they choose.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:23.000
And I agree with you.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I think most people
will be like, whoa.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
That was a lot.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:28.000
It's heavy.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I think I want to just kind of
bake myself in Netflix and Chex

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Mix instead.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:40.000
But there's also the
reality that there

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.000
are men and women, boys and
girls who hear that and go, OK,

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000
and start cracking
the cupboards open.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.000
And I just know
that for myself, I'm

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
extremely grateful that
you're willing to put it

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
all out there.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.000
You're so brutally honest,
so brutally authentic.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.000
That word authenticity
gets thrown around so much.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And I can tell you that for me
and for everybody else, that's

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
really what resonates.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
So whether or not you want
to, whether or not it's

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.000
the purpose behind it or not,
you're lighting the path.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
So thank you.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
DAVID GOGGINS:
Respect Thank you.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Thanks for having me.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000

I do read all the comments.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Not on today's episode, but
on many previous episodes

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.000
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
we discuss supplements.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
many people derive tremendous
benefit from them for things

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
like improving sleep, for
hormone support, and for focus.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
If you'd like to learn more
about the supplements discussed

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:20.000
on the Huberman Lab podcast,
please go to Live Momentous,

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000
spelled O-U-S. So that's
livemomentous.com/huberman.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000
If you're not already
following me on social media,

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I am hubermanlab on all
social media platforms.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
So that's Instagram, Twitter,
Threads, X, LinkedIn,

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
and Facebook.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And on all those
platforms, I discuss

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
science and science-related
tools, some of which

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
overlaps with the content
of the Huberman Lab podcast,

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000
but much of which is
distinct from the content

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
on the Huberman Lab podcast.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000
So again, it's hubermanlab on
all social media platforms.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
If you haven't
already subscribed

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
to our Neural
Network newsletter,

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
I encourage you to do so.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
It is completely zero cost.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.000
And it provides podcast
summaries and protocols

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.000
in the form of brief PDFs
of one to three pages,

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
things like deliberate
cold exposure,

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
protocol for
foundational fitness,

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000
protocol for deliberate
heat exposure,

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
for managing dopamine,
for optimizing your sleep,

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
and so on and so on.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Again, completely zero cost.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
You simply go to
hubermanlab.com,

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
go to the menu, scroll
down to Newsletter,

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
and click on the Newsletter tab.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
And you enter your
email to sign up.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
But I should point
out that we do not

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
share your email with anybody.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Thank you, once
again, for joining me

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000
for today's discussion with
the one and only David Goggins.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
And last but
certainly not least,

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
thank you for your
interest in science.
